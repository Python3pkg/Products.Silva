Priority settings
=================

Why?
----

This document lists the different priority settings for <silva:content> and
<silva:versionedcontent> metatypes (aka addables) in Silva and Silva products.
This listing helps reduce priority conflicts for existing and newly developed
products. Please list any new priority numbers in this document.

A few notes about reserved priority numbers:
1. negatives are reserved for Silva core metatypes
2. the 3 range is reserved for SilvaNewsNetwork

If an addable has no priority setting, thus defaulting to zero, it'll appear in
the middle of a listing, such as in the addables screen or the add select list.
Addables with the same priority (e.g. 0) are presented in alphabetical order,
as below.
