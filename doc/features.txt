    * Editor produces structured XML which can then be displayed as
      HTML in a web page, or exported (i.e. for publication on paper
      as PDF or import into MS Word). This also future proofs the
      information.

      structure content.

      order to publish content. Content can be published as well as
      expired automatically at a set time.

      documents while a previous version remains published.

      documents in one screen.
