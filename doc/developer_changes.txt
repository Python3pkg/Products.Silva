================================
Developer level changes in Silva
================================

From 1.0 to 1.1:

* The previously deprecated method 'archive_file_import' on Folder.py and
  the ImportArchive module have been removed. Code that depended on this
  should be rewritten to use the archivefileimport adapter.

* XSLT support for document renderers. While this shouldn't break
  existing code, it opens up new possibilities for extension
  writers. You can register your own XSLT templates with Silva that
  handle content rendering. Read doc/xslt_renderers_howto.txt for more   
  information

* new parser in forms-based editor. The existing parser for bold,
  italic and the like in the forms based editor has been scrapped and
  replaced with a parser that uses a simple HTML subset. The new
  parser should be more predictable for authors and a lot
  faster. Developers who have written their own widgets-based editors
  may need to modify code. If you already use the Silva-1.0
  infrastructure for finding the parser, the changes should be minimal
  and be limited to the UI, however. The Silva-1.0 pattern is::

    supp = context.editorsupport.getMixedContentSupport(model, node)
    supp.parse(text)

* new method on Folder objects, get_public_tree_all().  Returns a list
  of all published content objects (including containers) below this
  object (not including this object itself), including non-transparent
  containers like publications.
