Silva changes
  
  0.9.2 

    Features Added

        - Unicode support. All content and meta data can contain any character
          defined by the unicode standard. On upgrade you have replace or
          update your index_html set the the correct encoding; the default
          index_html does this.
          
        - High resolution image support. If you have PIL installed images can
          be both converted to JPEG or PNG and arbitary scaled for web
          presentation. The high resolution image can be used for printing. 

    Bugs Fixed

        - Fixed some bugs with copy/cut and paste: when an object is not
          allowed somewhere, it's now not possible to paste it there anymore,
          and also the id of the object to be pasted is now changed until
          it's unique (in the past, a bug in creating a unique id kept the
          status of a document 'public' in some cases).
	
  0.9.1

    Bugs Fixed

        - Datasource parameters store empty srtings instead of None
          for default values.

        - Fixed bug where the title of a SQLDatasource Asset was not set 
          in the edit tab.

        - Fix where the Groups administration button was shown, even
          if no service_groups was available.      

        - Now refreshes all installed products before an 
          "upgrade all" action.

        - Fixed bug where a new connection id was not updated correctly 
          on the SQL Datasource Asset

        - Indexer objects now show up in public table of contents always
          if placed (before they never did).

        - File assets could only be added by users with manager role;
          this now only requires an Author role.

  0.9.1 beta

    Features Added

        - Soft breaks in paragraphs (single enter).

        - Small API on Silva Root (add_silva_addable_forbidden() and
          clear_silva_addables_forbidden()) for absolutely forbidding
          visibility of certain meta_types in SMI. See also IRoot.py.
 
        - Improved tab_access user interface.

        - Group and VirtualGroup objects. Can be managed by going to
          'Group Administration' if Group product is installed. This
          makes group management a lot easier.

        - Optional message service ('service_message') which will send
          email on some workflow events.

        - Membership system. Different membership policies (working
          for instance with LDAP) can be plugged into Silva and
          enabled by placing a different Member Service
          ('service_members').

        - Access request system. A new UI so that users who do not
          have permissions to access a place can request roles on
          objects (optional).

        - New 'Data Source' is now enabled by default. The first
          implementation is an 'SQL Data Source' Asset. This can be
          used to import data from a relational database into a
          Document using the 'external data' element.

        - List titles have been removed and transformed into headings.
 
        - 'image_path' has been renamed to 'path' in the XML.

   Bugs Fixed

        - Fix where the "/manage" display link in the SMI tabs didn't
          didn't regard the local roles on the current object.

        - Asset reference fix where it didn't work in virtual host
          setups.

	- Fix some unicode issue related to tables (issue184)

	- Silva does no longer display non-installed content types
	  in list of addables (issue159).

	- Modification time of assets should now be updated properly
	  (issue147).

        - Some characters that were removed by the Silva editor
          shouldn't be removed -- made these work (issue 176).
	
        - New ('add') button should work properly again (issue 162).

        - Invalid image references now properly display error message
          (issue 204). 

  0.9.0.3

    Bugs Fixed

      - Merge from HEAD for add new object UI in tab-edit.

      - Fix where the "/manage" display link in the SMI tabs didn't
        regard the local roles on the current object.

      - Unicode fix for table rendering. Merge from HEAD branch.

      - Fix for asset reference to make it works in virtual host
        setups.

  0.9.0.2

    Bugs Fixed

      - When using LDAPUserManagement, a Attribute error on '_getOb'
        occured when adding Silva Images and -Files.

  0.9.0.1

    Bugs Fixed

      - After deleting a finished DocmaServer job, you are redirected
        to an existing page.

      - The (still disabled) externaldata element was registered wrong
        when enabled; fixed this (if you uncomment the code to enable it).
      
  0.9

    Features Added
 
        - Can change publication to folder and the reverse.

        - Links in editor now can have a 'target' option.
       
        - Images can now be hyperlinks.

        - Implementation of DataSource/DataElement for testing.

        - 'Code element' that can call arbitrary code included.
 
        - Access keys for common form buttons.

        - XML can be exported and imported.

        - Docma integration for importing/exporting to other document
          formats (like MS Word). This feature needs the separate
          Docma server (not yet released).

    Bugs Fixed

        - All '__index__.py' files are now non-empty, so that WinZip
          actually unpacks them...

        - Table edit bug fixed.

        - Table rendering code cleanup, better use of CSS

        - Memory leak fixed (really in ParsedXML and XMLWidgets).

          2 characters big.

        - Lists with style no bullets are now rendered with p tag.

        - Pasted ghosts now obtain a last author.

        - Indexer is now addable by editor and up (used to be 
          manager only). Added note in UI that indexer works for published
          content only. Also fixed a bug in the Indexer; it now
          also indexes 'index' (default) documents.

        - Demo index document gets automatically added to new Silva root.

        - 'Authorized users below this level' moved to sub screen of
          access, to make container tab_metadata scale better (this
          could be very slow on large sites).
      
        - Tweaked LDAPUserFolder.py so it works with more recent versions
          of LDAPUserFolder.

        - Fixed problem in the Access tab, where the user lookup sometimes
          lost the current selection.

         View code can be maintained in extension packages apart from 
         the Silva core.

       - Created installation framework for Silva extension packages.

      - Restriction on single column tables removed.

      - Various character encoding related issues.

      - Removed non functional button from "tab_publish".
