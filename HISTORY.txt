Silva changes

  Silva 2.1 (unreleased)

    Features added:

      - Moved the "new version" button in the editor screen below the feedback
        text, as opposed to nestled in the corner next to the text. This
        because a Silva trainer reported that a trainee couldn't figure out
        how to make a new version. Now it's more obvious, hopefully enough.

      - Renovated the Kupu image toolbox to make it more userfriendly. 
        Improved the alignments in the table toolbox. 

      - New "Editor Comments" Kupu Tool: displays the "internal comments"
        silva-extra metadata field if there are comments.  This
        promotes the visibility of internal / editor comments so that
        anyone editing the document will see them.  This tool is only
        visible if there are comments, and does not allow editing at this
        time.  This toolbox is non-collapsible, and requires a version
        of kupu newer than 1.4b1 to support non-collapsible toolboxes

      - Support for direct username assignment to clipboard. If the
        service_members service defines a method 'direct_user_lookup'
        that returns True, the user lookup UI in the access tab is
        changed to an add user to clipboard UI. This allows the adding
        of new users to a clipboard directly.

      - bug 100741: when groups are be used, the groups management
        screen also shows groups defined elsewhere (not just local to
        the container) and provides links to edit those groups

      - 100750: "Insert new object here" functionality.  When you
        select an object in a containers edit list, then select the
        new object to add from the "add new content drop-down", the
        new object will be placed at the location of the selected
        object in the edit list.

      - 100765 caching issues with /globals: All files in /globals are
        now tied to an Accelerated HTTP Cache Manager at
        <silva_root>/service_static_cache_manager.  This cache manager
        sets the appropriate HTTP headers to enable browsers to cache
        these objects.  The default setting is to cache for one week,
        and since the content is static, also cache non-anonymous
        requests.  The Silva root needs to be refreshed in order to
        take advantage of this cache manager.  Refreshing happens
        automatically during Silva upgrades.

      - 101351 Extension registration now allows multuple extensions in 
        the depends_on argument (in the form of tuples).  The zcml
        silva:extension depends_on directive, if present, now requires tuples.
        Additionally the extensions service now displays the dependencies for
        each extension and displays a warning next to each dependency that
        is not available.

    Features ported from 2.0 branch

      - additional behaviour to mangle.Id.new(), when passing True
        as the first argument one can suppress the ValueError raised
        on invalid ids (and always have a new id generated)

    Bugs Fixed:

      - Changed the new version button in the editor screen from an input to
        a button, to avoid css conflicts with frontend.css controls styles

      - fixed 156921: Escaping image title strings.

      - fixed 101240: SilvaExternalSource cannot be disabled.

      - fixed 100835: image upload screen should show allowed formats

      - fixed 101174: When an id is in use on the Zope level, inform 
                      users accordingly
      
      - Added True switch to Image.py tag method to escape double quotes.

      - Changed the 'priority' attribute of the silva:content zcml
        attribute to a float, to support more granular priorities
        (they way it was prior to Silva 2.0 zcml)

      - xslt renderer: fixed an extra whitespace issue that occurred
        when an image as linked, by setting indent="no" in normal_view.xslt

      - fixed 101791: problem with Link object as index of a container

    Bugfixes ported from 2.0 branch

      - fixed WuW144: Images were not always shown correctly in kupu 
        when resized.

      - fixed 158381: Group objects should be removable even if the 
        groups service isn't installed.

      - fixed 158384: can't add groups: title error issue

      - fixed 157010: anchors in links: # -> %23

      - fixed wuw144: Incorrect caching of images. 
                      (was reverted in silva-2.0.3b1)

      - fixed 150809: sidebar cache not invalidated when folder
        removed

      - Adding Groups, Virtual Groups and IPGroups was broken.

      - creationdate is once again set on versioned content.

      - The lookup window allowed one to add content and assets to
        ghostfolders, which isn't really advisable. This is no longer
        possible.

      - Fixed the thumbnailing/caching bug. When a thumbnailed image
        was resized back to 100%, a copy was being made to make sure
        the modification date headers are newer. I changed this so
        only the modifcation date is updated, but no copy of the image
        is being made, instead the original image is used.

      - Removed extra <br/> tag when viewing codesources in kupu.

      - fix for bug 109008: wrong tooltip when hovering over version
        status link

      - importing a zexp file with the Silva root in there was
        failing, because a Zope 3 event got fired that tried to re-add
        'collection' to 'service_metadata' while this is already
        there. Added a check to SilvaMetadata (1.0.1) that fixes this.

      - fix for bug: 101651: default settings for columns / rows on
        table creation in kupu

      - widget-based and xslt renderers render underlines in the same
        way with <span class="underline">

      - fixed 101494: Empty "source" elements break the XSLT renderer

      - fixed 101396: paragraphs in lists, tables rendered differently
        in widgets vs xslt renderers

      - fixed 101567: hires image links work from kupu but not widgets
        renderers

      - fixed 148863: toc rendering not XHTML compliant

      - Security.sec_get_all_roles_for_userid(userid) was broken in
        that it ignored the argument. Changed it to
        Security.sec_get_all_roles() and all calls to it, which were
        passing in the current userid anyway.

      - fixed "excessive recursion" error when users click 'new version' 
        to make a new copy of a silva document to edit then click the
        browser's back button and click 'new version' again.

      - adjusted the description in the add form of links, since that
        incorrectly indicated that absolute links would be checked.

      - on rare occasions, the external source tool in kupu wouldn't
        work for specific documents (double-unquoting the docref)

      - Ghosts and Ghostfolders no longer show editable titles in the
        rename screen.

    Features added:

      - additional behaviour to mangle.Id.new(), when passing True
        as the first argument one can suppress the ValueError raised
        on invalid ids (and always have a new id generated)

    Ported from 1.6 branch

      - The lookup window now opens in the directory that was last
        opened.

      - Several reserved ids such as 'home' were declared unreserved
        previously. Unfortunately it turned out that at least 'home'
        was reserved for a good reason, so to be sure re-reserved
        these ids, except for 'search'.

      - In the lookupwindowfield, a previously selected value is now
        shown selected.


  Silva 2.0

    Features added:

      - Use layers in our tests.  This makes sure that we can use
        unittests that set up and tear down the component architecture
        without interfering with the components that were set up for
        the integrational tests using the actual Products' ZCML.

      - Use `DefaultUnicodeEncodingConflictResolver` instead of the
        default `Z2UnicodeEncodingConflictResolver` for page
        templates.  This means that our page templates will not
        attempt to implicitly convert to something when a string is
        not unicode and it's not a string containing ASCII characters
        only.

      - Removed obsolete five:traversable statements from zcml.

      - PageTemplateFile was used with non-existing page
        templates. This used to work in versions prior to Zope 2.10,
        but failed now. Changed __init__.py so that these
        PageTemplateFile instances are not needed anymore.

      - Use new MessageFactory from Zope 3.3 to make it compatible
        with Zope 2.10

      - Changed set_mapping to mapping arguments for message IDs

      - Changed css styling of the preview publisher buttons, making
        easier for users to integrate the publisher into their own
        layout.

      - If no title is given, the index is considered a 'pure' anchor,
        and will not be found by Indexers.

      - XHTML compliance improvements

    Bugs Fixed:

      - A security fix in Zope 2.10.3 broke install.py.

  Silva 1.6

    Features added:

      - 2007-03-15: Containers show their modification datetime in the
        'modified' column of the contents table in edit mode.

      - If a file or image asset has an extension in its id, this is
        preserved in the fullmedia export, so if the zip file is unzipped
        by hand, the file types of the assets are obvious in those cases,
        and will preview properly in operating systems that support it.

      - If present, SilvaLayout will automaticly be registered in
        service_extensions if a new SilvaRoot is created. Note that just
        having the SilvaLayout product on the file system will break the
        ZODB based layout.

      - The Extension Service page now has a button 'rebuild catalog' which
        will empty the silva catalog and reindex all silva content.

      - Added Atom/RSS feed capabilities to arbitrary containers. To
        use this go to the 'settings' in the properties tab of a
        container, and enable the checkbox marked 'allow feeds'. After
        that, adding /rss.xml or /atom.xml after that container's url
        just works. The feeds, for now, are feeds of only the
        published Silva Documents in that container.

      - IVersioning has a method get_first_publication_date, which returns
        the earliest date any version of the content was ever published.
        Useful for RSS/Atom output.

      - Silva Find features: When adding a new silvaroot a SilvaFind
        instance named "search" will be placed in the root of the site.
        SilvaFind has many improvements over the SilvaSearch
        functionality, which is still available if you remove or rename the
        SilvaFind instance. For more information on SilvaFind, have a look
        at the SilvaFind README file.

      - Automatic fulltext cataloging of pdf files, when the pdftotext
        command-line application is found on the path.

      - Automatic fulltext cataloging of word files, when the antiword
        command-line application is found on the path.

      - Automatic fulltext cataloging of textfiles using utf8 encoding,
        also the content-type header of textfiles now set the charset to utf8.

      - Ghosts now override `get_modification_datetime` to get their
        modification date from the haunted object, allowing the
        `Last-Modified` header to be set in a convenient way.
        (issue 1645)

      - Services may now implement
        `Products.Silva.interfaces.IInvisibleService`, which means
        that they want to be excluded from the services listing.
        (issue 1700)

      - The published status of containers changed: A folder is published
        when its default document is published, not published when its
        default document isn't published, and if no default document is
        present, it is considered published if any of its contents are
        published. This cuts down on some unnecessary recursion, as well as
        giving editors a nice way to temporarily exclude trees from
        navigation, so that they can be worked on.

      - Changed title fields to string fields, for easy FF fill-in

      - External sources inside headers or table cells were never allowed. An
        alert box is shown now, to make this clearer. (issue 1578)

      - Disabled custom kupu context menu, so that the original browser
        context menu is shown. This allows firefox users to use the firefox
        spellchecker

      - Changed the lang attribute of the layout macro html tag to get the
        lang from metadata, as in: https://infrae.com/issue/silva/issue1566
        Lower cased the language codes in the metadata set, as in:
        https://infrae.com/issue/silva/issue1668

      - Moved the css selectors for rollover tooltips in Kupu toolboxes
        higher in the cascade so they apply to all toolboxes. Added tooltips
        for the new anchor/index item toolbox and the abbr/acronym toolbox.

      - Fixed up the Indexer:
          Add tbody
          Add odd/even cycling for table rows
          Remove double defines
          Fix title for cases where there isn't one
          Fix display for empty indexer
          Reduce arbitrary indenting

      - Changed css styling of the preview publisher buttons, making it easier
        for users to integrate the publisher into their own layout.

      - Fix for TOCs and AutoTOCS where docs that didn't have a title
        didn't appear because the link was empty (it was there). Now the
        id shows up so visitors can at least click it.

      - Renovated the TOC/AutoToc rendering, replacing the ancient, legacy,
        Netscape4 compatible image-based indent, where long titles break
        onto the next, non-indented line. The new rendering uses nested
        lists, which make the rendering easier to style, and more accessible
        to boot. The lists have the class 'toc-list', and the links have the
        'toc-link' class. Added an adapter to perform the new-style
        rendering.

      - The new AutoTOC adapter is now used in SilvaDocument TOC rendering,
        for both the widgets- and xslt-based renderers.

      - Tocs display links with a trailing slash because there may be
        'edit/tab_preview' appended to it, but this conflicts with links
        made in the editor that are rendered without the slash. Moved the
        slash into the appendage.

      - Removed get_layout_macro(.py) from the layout installation code and
        thus it won't be present in the ZODB in future new installs. This is
        legacy code from the doomed layout service development that has now
        been superceded by SilvaLayout. Existing get_layout_macro python
        scripts can be deleted.

      - Updated standard_error_message with direct call of
        layout_macro.html, 404 in title, adjusted informative text.

      - index items now have an 'index title' attribute in addition to an
        'anchor name' attribute. The title is used for displaying in an
        indexer. The name is used for the anchor, and thus should be a valid
        anchor name. If no title is given, the index is considered a 'simple'
        anchor, and will not be found by Indexers.

    Ported from 1.5 branch

      - Fixes for IE7 css selectors

      - With a base tag in the layout template the publisher form in public
        preview 404's. The form now has a constructed action instead of a point.
        This will work for sites that don't define a base tag too (issue1705).

      - When there's a base tag in the layout_macro the forms in /public,
        such as the subscription form, return a 404. If the form action is
        constructed using absolute_url, it works. This should also be
        backwards compatible, working for sites that don't include a base
        tag. Tweaked formatting of the search form while at it.

      - alt attribute for meta_type icons now have the name of the meta_type
        instead of 'Unknown' (Issue 1654)

      - Simplified the content.html layout file to make it easier to
        understand. Moved the content call into the layout macro.
        Reformatted the comments.

      - Default installations will have the html meta tags and accessibility
        links skipped in the layout macro to have better out of the box
        performance. Site managers can turn them on as needed.

      - 2007-01-24: added an explicit base tag to the layout template, so
        that it no longer includes a trailing slash which zope adds for
        all containerlike objects, which Silva Documents are. This means
        that linking to anchors now works like you would expect it to.

      - Changed calls from getMetdata to getMetadataValue where possible,
        resulting in a significant performance gain.

      - Non Ascii characters in names or values of codesource paramaters
        no longer result in errors.

      - Incorrect links entered by hand or imported broke the path adapter.
        Since this made editing the document impossible, we added some
        defensive code.

      - Anchors around divs break in explorer, so they were put inside in
        the xslt renderer.

      - i18n problem in views/edit/Asset/File/submit.py (Thanks Benno!)

      - Solved problem with trailing slashes in relative Links. (Thanks
        Benno!)

    Bugs fixed:

      - 2007-03-15: Ghost and GhostFolder Metadata Access Handlers
        return read only metadata bindings, so that the metadata of
        the haunted original can not be accidentally written to.

      - Added a base tag so all Silva screens are based in API space,
        a.k.a. */edit/ (see issue: https://infrae.com/issue/silva/issue1588)

      - Having a base tag fixes the potential 404 in the access screen
        (issue 1588).

      - Fixed AutoTOC depth feature (issue 1693)

      - Fixed behavior in Internet Explorer where it's impossible to change
        the "link to" field in the image toolbox in kupu, by removing the
        onkeypress event.

      - Fixed minor bugs in kupu table toolbox where the column widths
        field did not get updated (issue 1577)

      - Fixed bug in scaling of images, where images with a scaling of 100%
        would return the modification date of the original hires image,
        creating problems with caching (issue 1557)

      - Fix https://infrae.com/issue/silva/issue1642, where the
        catalog was indexing XML tags.

      - Fixed id mangling (https://infrae.com/issue/silva/issue1686), spaces
        are no longer allowed in new Ids.

  Silva 1.6b4

    Bugs fixed:

      - New version of SilvaMetadata (0.12) released which fixes a bug
        where storing of empty metadata fields/deleting metadata values was
        impossible.

  Silva 1.6b3 (first public beta)

    Features added

      - Assets now have a version_status method that always returns 'public'
        which means they can be found by SilvaFind.

      - Old version cleanup code was made more robust and can now be
        used to delete all old versions older than a certain date,
        instead of just all old versions.

      - Silva now uses ZCML for registration of Silva extensions and
        the content types they define. See doc/extension.txt for more
        information. See also doc/developer_changes.txt.

      - The Version/CatalogedVersion base class does not expect a
        title argument anymore. This title argument had been unused
        for a long time. This requires minor adjustments in some subclasses
        of Version and CatalogedVersion. For more information see
        doc/developer_changes.txt.

      - Much i18n polishing.

      - Made image titles required, since they provide the alt attribute.

      - Added adapters so we now have a simple API to index, unindex
        and reindex content objects, folders and assets. Adapt to
        Products.Silva.adapters.ICatalogIndexable.

      - Moved document info in the document status screen to an info column
        like assets have.

      - Refactored/cleaned up tab_status_macros to remove code duplication.

      - Changed the add screens for Files and Images so the upload (file) field
        comes first, followed by a subhead 'optional fields', because Authors
        were not seeing the tip that they don't have to fill in an id.

      - Added a more discreet favicon for the public views.

      - For the frontend,css that gets placed in the ZMI, import the
        frontend.css in globals to stop duplication but still give the end user
        the option to edit the preview typography.

      - Clarified descriptions of exporting versions.

      - Added the possibility of using silva lookup to filter on multiple
        meta-types.

      - The import has an extra option: 'replace content' which, when
        enabled, replaces existing content objects with objects from the
        import when they have the same ids. It treats folderish strcutures in
        the same way a POSIX cp would: i.e. in the target folders are used
        if they exist, and created if not.

      - Moved the set_content_type and set_cache_headers scripts into the
        new view system, to the view 'headers'.

      - Switched to Kupu 1.4 (the current 'trunk' (unreleased) version).

      - Moved the 'kupu/silva' directory to 'Silva/kupu' (so to the
        Silva core) to ease release management. If you develop Silva,
        see README.txt in Silva/kupu for information on what to do
        when you change kupu templates, or when Silva needs to be
        ported to a newer version of kupu.

      - Renamed 'kupu' and 'kupu_silva' in the Silva root to
        'service_kupu' and 'service_kupu_silva', respectively.

      - Removed old deprecated (de)activation API. For details, see
        'doc/developer_changes.txt'.

    Bugs fixed:

      - Browser language settings was ignoring English language,
        meaning it would fall back on the first language that was
        non-English in the settings. Now made English is a language
        explicitly known by Silva and SilvaDocument. This also means
        English can be explicitly selected in the user settings
        view. (issue 1572)

      - The user settings view was not dealing with language variants
        (such as zh_TW) correctly. It now displays these and responds
        to these properly.

      - User settings view works again. This was broken as Five views
        were in use for header settings. Made header settings view
        registration wider (for everything), and made Member object
        five:traversable.

      - Removed commented out template code for listing all email
        addresses.

      - Fixed various i18n translations in Versioned content

      - Fixed public restriction bug cfr. issue 1588 and 1596

      - Fixed bug in sidebar uplinks where you couldn't jump up and out of a
        publication.

      - TRANSMAP regular expression containing weird characters was
        not in use anymore in Image.py or File.py, so removed it.

      - Fix for issue1516: space above kupu in news items. Other
        extensions can control the feedback space too.

      - Fixed Issue1449: Siblings Sidebar should display title or id

      - Fix for Firefox html edit problem in kupu

      - Single paragraphs in table cells were rendered by the xslt as
        opposed to the widget renderer. They are now removed.

      - XSLT renderers did not take virtual hosting situations into account
        when rendering images and links in documents.

      - In 'normal' headings index items were not rendered by the XSLT
        renderers.

      - Added div with css class to make public preview buttons
        positionable in public layouts (they can be behind something
        if layers are used), thus added css class for the form too,
        and moved local style to the css so the stylesheet can be
        overridden by user.

      - The previous fix to the public preview buttons broke keeping the user
        in the same screen when making new versions, i.e. for the metadata
        screen, where when making a new version the user was returned to the
        editor, while in fact metadata needed to be edited. Removed a classic
        very ugly url.

      - If a user names the Silva root 'root', it gets priority in the dtml
        namespace, so change the variable in silva.css and frontend.css to
        'root_url'

      - Full media export/import of images did not take account of format
        scaling and cropping.

      - XMLexport of SilvaDocument passed a string instead of an integer to
        get_tree/get_public_tree, so limiting the depth of a toc while
        using xslt rendering was ignored.

      - Images in tables were not shown correctly in the xslt rendering.

      - The zip import of assets (as opposed to the fullmedia zip import)
        did not take into account the 'replace identical ids' option. It
        does now.

      - The xslt rendering allowed empty width and height attributes on
        images, which breaks in IE. These are now caught.

      - The lookup window had some problems with incorrect content type
        filtering, and a strange javascript issue, where 'document' was
        empty. Both are fixed.

      - FSDTMLMethod and FSPageTemplate were imported directly
        from FileSystemSite product instead of from fssite module

      - Changed mangle.Path.fromObject() so it doesn't return '' anymore when
        from and to objects are the same.

      - Handle user with user id different from login properly
        (issue 1471)

      - Fixed bug in XML export (to_xml()) of Link objects, escaping
        (entitizing) title and url properly now.

      - Removed quote (probably typo) from some JS string in lookupwindowfield.

      - There was a bug in the cleanup script listed in MAINTENANCE.txt,
        fixed.

      - Shut up a security deprecation warning for PROPFIND.

    Ported from 1.5 branch

      - Retain fragment information (#foo) on URLs when converting
        from URL to Zope path and back. This fixes issue 1592.

      - User settings screen did not work when user did not have
        sufficient rights in the Silva Root. This is now fixed.

      - Fixed problem in SilvaDocument that used kupu where it whasn't
        needed and caused js exceptions

      - Fix for issue 1618 where messagebox didn't appear in ie also
        removed nbsp in macro_index

      - Fixed issues where hide_from_toc filters wouldn't work in
        ghost contexts.  Also removed some unused cruft from previous
        filtering implementations.

      - Added a ReferenceLookupWindowField, to store references to zope
        objects instead of urls.

      - Fixed issue 1608 where tab_edit_revoke_approval caused
        versioning errors

      - In the tab_status "set timings" caused an error without saving
        the changes and returned a wrong tab

      - XML export rewrote the urls of links and images on export, which
        was a bad thing. They now have extra rewritten_ attributes, which
        are only used by the xslt rendering.

      - XML export of Silvadocuments with images that have no link attribute
        was broken.

      - The full media export now uses a tempfile instead of an in memory
        stringIO to build the zipfile, hopefully improving memory
        footprint.

      - Added an extra note on zope.i18n.translate to
        doc/developer_changes.txt.

      - Ghostfolders exported haunted content, which broke asset ids in the
        zip. Since this content was ignored on import it is no longer
        exported.

      - Explicitly delete model from request in view_version() to break a
        cyclic reference that prevents model from being garbage collected.

      - Add ZCatalog index upgrader to comply with an API change in Zope.

      - The new lookup window was registering resources under the name
        scripts. This name is too broad and was in fact being
        overridden by a Silva extension that introduced its own
        scripts, causing the Silva core to break. Renamed this to
        silva_scripts in the core.

      - The cropping dialog was broken, fixed.

      - Fixed non-interpolation issues with message ids in the image
        UI.

      - Fix in the public preview screen; it broke for ghosts and
        other objects that only register the 'public' view for
        versions.

      - Small context bug fixes in the LookupWindowWidget.

      - Some text related to reserved ids wasn't properly translated.

      - Failure in user preferences dialog if the browser for some reason
        has no preferred languages configured whatsoever.

      - The back button should now always go back to the last edit page
        visited.

      - The tab_edit_make_copy script now redirects to tab_edit instead of
        returning it, fixing a problem with public preview (where pressing
        the back button sometimes caused the make_copy script to get triggered)
        and making the URL in tab_edit look better after creating a new copy.

      - File uploads were broken due to a missing return_url variable. Fixed.

      - Fixed multi-value form element support in external sources.

      - Anchor links are rendered in a non-HTML compliant but in a
        Silva backwards compatible way.

      - XSLT and widgets based renderer for anchor links are identical.

      - Fixed illegal attribute value for cellpadding in XSLT renderer.

      - Fixed unicode error in approval.

      - GhostFolders (and probably also Ghosts) could mess up
        SilvaLayout if they referred to a location with a different
        skin setting than the location in which the GhostFolder is
        accessed (even when just looking at its title). This has now
        been fixed.

  1.5

    Features added

      - Already available in beta 1, but not in our HISTORY.txt
        file. Buttons have been added to the UI to publish and close
        content more directly.

      - Added the newest translations from the Launchpad Rosetta system.
        (https://launchpad.net/products/silva/+translations)

    Bugs fixed

      - Container policies are not hardcoded anymore for container add
        forms (add folder or add publication). Instead, the
        information on what container policies are available is
        retrieved from the service where they are registered.

      - A lot more places where i18n interpolation wasn't taking place
        anymore (${foo} in message texts) are fixed by using an
        explicit call to zope.i18n.translate() instead of unicode().

      - Restore "install default layout" functionality for ZODB
        layout; we were too vigorous in removing layout related code
        and removed too much.

      - Removed some more traces of FileSystemSite-based layout system.

      - Some fixes in the refactored lookup window code.

      - Some cleanups of GhostFolder code, fixing an error that
        appeared when Five views interacted with them.

      - Fix in Ghost code stops another error related to Five view
        interaction with acquisition.

      - Eliminated Zope 2.8.5 warnings on startup.

      - Access screen can be accessed again by authors.

      - Slight simplification of icon generation code which in some
        circumstances gave rise to a bug.

      - get_layout_macro was stored with DOS line endings, switched
        to Unix to be in line with the rest of the source code.

      - Further bugfixes in Kupu and Kupu integration, includes Kupu
        1.3.5.

  1.5b1

    Features added

      - Changed over Silva so it works with Zope 2.8/Five/Zope 3
        interfaces instead of old-style interfaces. See
        doc/developer_changes for more details. These interfaces were
        in SilvaLayout as marker interfaces in the past.

      - Adjusted test infrastructure so it works with Five.

      - Use Zope 2.8 style transactions.

      - Changed over Silva so it works with the Five/Zope 3 translation
        architecture, using Five. See doc/developer_changes for more
        details.

      - Some parts of the Silva UI (for instance the lookup window in the
        edit views) are now based on Zope 3 adapters and views, using Five.
        This is a first step of a long evolutionary transition for the Silva
        UI.

      - Converted IViewerSecurity, IIndexable, IHaunted, IAssetData to
        Zope 3 adapters.

      - The silva-extra metadata set now has a language field that stores
        a ISO 639 two letter language code.

      - Language setting in the user preferences is now shown as human
        readable text, not as a language code. Moreover, using Zope 3's
        locale database, names for languages are shown in the configured
        language.

      - Added support for Kupu 1.3.4.

    Bugs fixed

      - Added missing 'is_default' method on SilvaObject, it was already
        available on Content but some new functionality (closing objects
        from tab_edit of Container types) made that it was required for
        other types as well.

      - Never really an official feature, the FileSystemSite-based layout
        system has been removed from the code. This means that
        service_layouts is now gone.

      - Kupu now uses frontend.css instead of an almost entire copy.

      - Moved 'get_extsource_url.py' out of SilvaDocument to the core to
        allow using it from other products.

  1.4.1

    Bugs fixed

      - Added support for Kupu 1.3.2, in which a SilvaExternalSources related
        bug is fixed.

      - Fixed unicode bug in table rendering.

      - SilvaDocument's 'fulltext' method returns a list as it did in
        the past, now that Zope has been bugfixed to handle this
        again.

      - Fallback so that interlaced PNG files now work with Silva
        Images, even though thumbnails are disabled in that case.

  1.4

    Features added

      - Added a JavaScript registry for onload handlers and used that to
        do some refactoring of the tab_edit pagetemplates.

      - Added support for Kupu 1.3.

      - Added a field to the silva-extra metadata-set: hide_from_tocs.
        By default set to do not hide, when this is set to hide on a piece
        of content, that content (and what it contains) will not show up in
        tables of content.

      - Added a link_type attribute to Link (Version) objects. Adding
        relative links is now possible.

      - Browsing to objects (for e.g. link and image lookups) has been
        refactored, now there's only a single implementation of the lookup
        window, and somewhat cleaner HTML.

      - It is now possible to have table cells without a width attribute,
        which means you can style your tables through css entirely. To use
        this feature, give the column widths a value of '*'.

    Bugs Fixed

      - Un-fixed a Zope-2.7.7 compatibility issue with using ZCTextIndex.
        The original fix was basically a work arround for Zope bug. This
        means Silva can no longer work properly with Zope-2.7.7.

      - Updated tests/README.txt to reflect the now preferred way for
        running the tests. ZopeTestCase-0.9.8 is now required.

      - When content without a maintitle was exported, it could not be
        imported again.

      - Image tags in exported silva documents had their src attribute
        converted to an absolute url on export.

      - In some cases the registered upgraders for the new Silva version
        would not run. This is fixed by regsitering upgraders for all Silva
        versions, even if the particular version didn't really have any
        upgrading to do.

      - Saving metadata in tab_metadata did not trigger a catalog reindex
        action.

      - The test_subscriptions would fail if the MaildropHost was installed.

      - pathToUrl() (path.py) has been renamed to pathToUrlPath(). Fixed
        tests accordingly.

      - Various issues in Kupu have been addressed.

      - Fixed various unicode errors related to PTS.

      - Fixed bug where En didn't appear in the language list.

      - i18n cleanups.

  1.3

    Features added

      - All Silva css files (silva, silvaContentStyle, frontend) have been
        cleaned up, a table of contents added, and the properties have been
        reordered following W3C recommendations. They validate.

      - The border color of focused form fields highlights.

      - Editable metadata fields now have labels, allowing the field to be
        focused with a mouse click.

      - The content workspace now has a sidebar, which displays siblings of
        the item in the current folder.

      - The middleground of properties and its subscreens is now handled by
        a macro.

      - A macro_nonscreen has been added, for situations where the user clicks
        to a screen that doesn't exist, e.g. there is no addables screen for
        folders, but the user can navigate to it via the sidebar.

      - macro_index has been cleaned up, and doesn't try to load Kupu unless
        Kupu is needed.

      - The service_subscriptions has a service icon.

    Bugs fixed

      - Fixed a bug in the editor transformations that made that external
        source form fields couldn't contain non-ascii characters in Kupu.

      - Fixed the naive inclusion of Silva extensions in view trees, which
        caused an AttributeError on service_views when a view-less
        extension, like SilvaLayout, was installed.

      - Cosmetic improvements to the public Indexer rendering.

      - Changed the xmlimporter to import metadata sets that are actually
        present in the import instead of iterating over all installed metadata
        sets.

      - Fixed a unicode bug in the xmlimporter.

      - Fixed an API incompatibility with Zope 2.7.7 ZCTextIndex (fix works
        with 2.7.6 as well).

      - Suppressed the xsltrenderer's copying of silva related namespace
        attributes and declarations in rendered html.

      - Fixed a bug where unknown classnames used on p-tags (usually after
        copy/paste to Kupu) confused the editor and widget renderer.

      - The user clipboard no longer hits the right side of the window.

      - Numerous i18n bugs have been fixed.

      - The form field widths have been fixed in the csv source edit screen.

      - Various bugs and the layout have been fixed in tab_status_macros.

      - If a document heading is empty, an empty h2 tag is not rendered.

      - Feedback in user settings (always saying the language has been
        edited, even if it wasn't) has been fixed.

      - Access keys in the contents screen have been fixed, so it is now
        possible to add items using just the keyboard.

      - A bug in the select_all macro js has been fixed.

      - Fixed incompatibility of code source forms between editors, requires
        Kupu 1.3 (issue 1351).

      - Fixed problem with paths, that made that if you'd revoke a pending
        version of an object using the button in tab_edit of that object and
        then would edit it with Kupu, saving would fail (issue 1345).

      - Fixed hyperlink support in headings in Kupu (issue 1324).

      - Fixed the request approval button (issue 1337).

      - Removed 'publish now' button from the public preview screen for
        authors (who are not allowed to publish anything) (issue 1369).

      - Fixed image cropping button (issue 921).

      - Fixed charset problems in public/subscriptor view (issue 1357).

      - Fixed modification time in tab_status' version management table (issue
        1355).

      - Fixed SilvaMetadata tests (XML validation problem) (issue 1354).

      - Fixed AttributeError (__call__) on DummyMessageID (issue 1342).

      - Fixed some bugs in Image, when an image was stored on the FS and
        removed, a Silva Image object referring to it didn't work anymore
        (issue 1350).

      - Added 'X-Is-Fallback-For' directive in the appropriate .po files
        (providing information about fallbacks for e.g. de-ch to de)
        (issue 1305).

      - After a cut/paste action, the paste buttons now (correctly) disappear
        from view (issue 1326).

      - Fixed problems with IE mangling URLs (hrefs of anchors and src for
        images), by storing an additional attribute and reading that if
        available. Requires Kupu 1.2.2.

      - Fixed bug in exporting ZODB-based files to the filesystem (for
        ExtFile), which also fixed a unit test (issue 1384).

  1.3b3

    Note: there were a couple internal betas, this is the first public one.

    Features added

      - WebDAV support for Silva. Silva can now be accessed by a WebDAV
        client.

      - User interface refactoring for the properties (metadata) tab, and
        settings tab.

      - Silva users can now set their preferred language on the user
        settings page if PTS is installed. The preference is stored in a
        cookie which expires after one year.

      - Partial upgrades, an feature that allows upgrading imported
        Z-exported Silva content. This feature should be handled with care,
        as it cannot always be guaranteed to be correct.

      - Public preview mode now has a back button to go back to the
        Silva UI. For EXISTING SILVA SETUPS, the preview_html Python
        script in the Silva root needs to be edited so it reads:
        return context.index_html(view_method='public_preview')
        (change 'preview' to 'public_preview').

      - Metadata sets can have a 'category' property. This property
        can be used to define special purpose metadata sets.

      - The minimal_role and category properties are exported and
        imported to/from the XML metadata set definitions.

      - Export button in publish screen was replaced to a more logical
        location.

      - The publish screen controls have been reorganized and a publish
        now button has been added, saving users a click (the publish now
        checkbox is gone).

      - A publish now button has been added to almost all screens where a
        user my want to publish now, including contents, preview, public
        preview, propoerties and its subscreens.

      - Users can close and publish (now) content in the contents screen.
        This makes moving of items much easier, obviating the need to switch
        to the publish screen to close.

      - Both the contents and the publish screen have import and export
        (transport) buttons.

    Bugs fixed

      - RNG schemas are up-to-date.

      - Optimizations in xml export:
          * Do not use the wrappers for the dom, but the DOM directly.
          * Improved metadata values handling

      - URLs generated by Indexers, now point to the correct anchors in
        the documents referenced.

      - Fixed issue1246, where the cropbox didn't work correctly.

      - Saving metadata uses Formulator forms for improved validation.

      - The import/export of metadata values other than string now works
        correctly. (previously only datetime values were, hackishly, checked
        for.) This requires an update of Formulator.

      - Fixed acquistion problem with ExternalSource objects and Kupu: when
        adding or updating an ExternalSource object that had an id that
        returned another object using acquisition, Kupu would display a 404
        page instead of the source's form. This has now been fixed: instead
        of acquisition of the id a full url is used to find the source.
        Note that this requires Kupu 1.2.1+.

      - Fixed issue 1275, copy/paste and cut/paste now queries Zope for the
        ids it has generated rather than generating them in sync (which was
        broken due to a change in Zope's renaming behaviour).

      - Fixed issue 1224, the 'model' variable inside the form of external
        sources now points to the document in which the code source element
        was embedded rather than to the code source itself. Note that this
        requires Kupu 1.2.1 and SilvaExternalSources 0.10.2.

      - Fix unicode issues in SilvaDocument (if
        PlacelessTranslationService is used) by introducing a
        safeJoin() operation.

      - Fixed issue 1277, unicode error in membership form saving mechanism.

      - Fixed broken i18n:name (string interpolation) in user lookup screen.

      - Fixed issue 1288, tab_status_approve should never create copies
        anymore without publishing them.

      - Fixed issue 1311, some problems with nested lists in Kupu.

      - Fixed issue 1301, Kupu now uses object.get_title() where appropriate.

      - Updated Silva software version number to 1.3

  1.2

    Bugs fixed

      - batch.py now imports make_request from ZTUtils.Zope, seems to
        fix some test failures.

      - layout service doesn't render pages when called from Python.

  1.2b1

    Features added

      - Silva has been i18n-ed. (Works with Placeless Translation Service
        1.0). There's an English, German and Dutch version of Silva now.

      - Subscriptions feature: visitors can now easily subscribe to
        publish events of VersionedContent objects (like Silva Documents).
        If a visitor is subscribed, he will receive notifications by email
        whenever a publication event for this object is triggered.

      - Version management feature:

          * reviewing older versions of content objects
          * comparing different versions side-by-side
          * reverting to older versions of content
          * removal of selected old versions

      - When ExtFile is installed, a site manager can switch between ZODB
        storage and file system storage of assets with one click of a
        button.

    Bugs fixed

      - Fixed a bug in the xml exporter that tripped on the export of
        citatation elements

      - Link objects now accept other protocols in the URL too (https,
        news, ftp, mailto).

      - Fixed a bug in the xml importer that could result in loss of text
        data.

      - Fixed color of error display when something could not be pasted.
        Note: see doc/developer_changes.txt for information about the impact
        this change had on the API.

      - Removed namespace declaration from XML produced by Kupu.

      - Fixed standard_error_message, it's now displayed properly when a user
        chooses 'cancel' when the browser asks for login credentials.

      - Fixed problem with vanishing paragraphs after a Kupu save.

      - Fixed case where XSLT renderer produced non-HTML tags.


  1.1.2

  1.1.1

    Features Added

      - Added a new xslt renderer that renders Silva Documents without a
        title at the top.

      - Made kupu the default editor if available.

    Bugs Fixed

      - TOC rendered with the XSLT renderer now use the correct context.

      - Fixed a nasty unicode error in the XSLT renderer, that somehow
        slips through in Zope 2.7.2 and only breaks Silva in 2.7.3

      - Fixed issue where is_published return true in situations where
        there isn't any viewable content.

      - URLs are now rendered correctly in the context of a Ghost object.

      - Added 'Delete objects' permission to authors and up, this was not
        used in previous Zope versions but is in 2.7.3.

      - Fixed bug that made Internet Explorer generate paths to images in
        Kupu that couldn't be reached by unauthorized users (issues 1165
        and 1168).

      - Updated footer of the Silva documentation template, used to mention
        incorrect Silva and Zope versions.

      - Fixed bug with metadata sets with restricted access, they were not
        accessible with people who did have the required role(s) but didn't
        have them defined on the root.

      - Headings are no longer incorrectly discarded by the xslt renderer.

      - Code and data sources no longer incorrectly copy their parameters
        into the result html.

      - Images in SilvaDocuments now get their widths, heights, aligments
        and titles in the xml export, which fixes some bugs in the xslt
        rendering.

      - Tables should have a width of 100%, but this got removed in 1.0

      - Nested lists only worked in the xslt renderers when the outer list
        was bulleted. Nested lists can now have any type normal lists can.

      - Newlines can be used instead of <br> in the forms editor.

      - Markup and linebreaks within tables is no longer removed in the
        xslt renderers.

  1.1

    Features added

      - Allowed access to the cleanup adapter from Python scripts.

      - Streamlined the creation of XSLT renderers.

      - All objects with renderers registered for them have a way to
        turn new-style rendering off explicitly for that object in
        particular (not just in renderer registry).

    Bugs fixed

      - Replaced print statement in Indexer for a LOG entry.

      - The Indexer could break when the content tree it indexed contains
        Silva Publications.

      - Protect methods on the service_files.

      - Content publication state is now not touched anymore when imported
        using *.zexp files in the ZMI.

      - zip-file XML import/export of Silva root should now work.

      - Unused XSLT support cruft has been cleaned up.

      - Fixed problem with very long titles and ids in lookup screens, they're
        truncated now

      - Ghosts and ghost folders should import properly with zip file import.

      - Fixed incorrect recursive call for get_public_tree_helper

    Removals

      - Remnant of SQLDataSource removed. Use SilvaExternalSources instead.
        (SQLDataSource was deprecated since version 0.9.3).

      - Remnants of old archive file import code (for bulk creation of
        assets) has been removed. Use the archivefileimport adapter instead.

  1.1 beta 2

    Features added

      - Revision of the XSLT support so that it can work with any
        object in Silva, not just Silva Document. The properties tab
        and service_renderer_registry also now take this into
        account. If you're upgrading from 1.1b1, please remove
        service_renderer_registry in the ZMI and do a refresh all in
        service_extensions to install a new one.

    Bugs fixed

      - Remnants of old parser code in SilvaDocument (silvaparser.py,
        search.py) and all references to it have been removed. In
        EditorSupportNested the render_links method has been removed -
        this might break old extensions.

      - Remove a memory leak from XSLT support.

      - Some fixes for the full-media import/export system.

      - The 'get link reference' buttons in the forms-based editor now
        return the new-style HTML subset references.

      - The forms-based editor now highlights index items correctly in
        nested lists and tables.

      - Fixed the rename form for objects with no title.

  1.1 beta 1

    Features added

      - XSLT support for rendering Silva objects. See
        doc/renderers_howto.txt for more information.

      - New parser for SilvaDocument forms-based editor, using a HTML
        subset instead of the old-style method using special
        characters.

      - A new XML export/system that can also export and import asset
        data.

      - abbr and acronym support for both forms editor and Kupu.

      - Implemented get_public_tree_all(depth) method.

    Bugs fixed

      - Silva File and Image asset use settings from the 'nearest' (by
        acquisition) service_files again.

      - Do not copy over properties anymore when changing a folder to
        publication or back. Silva does not use properties anymore.

      - Properties tab for Ghost Folder works again.

      - Fixed bug in images that caused a ZODB transaction on every public
        view.

      - Fixed kupu transformation bug that made paragraph type not
        come through on save.

      - The target attribute was not taken into account in the silva
        xml -> kupu html transformation. Fixed.

      - Fixed unicode issues in Groups support. This is only an issue
        for Membership extensions that allow non-ascii characters in
        their group names, for instance the ones based on LDAP. Core
        groups support is not affected by this change.

  1.0 final

    Bugs fixed

      - Made the 0.9.3-1.0 Image upgrade even more forgiving, basically it
        will now not break on anything anymore, it will print a warning to
        the zLOG on every exception.

      - Problem in Kupu transformations that made 'spurious' <p> elements
        without content appear on the page.

      - Problem in Kupu transformations that made <div>'s get removed
        completely from a document on save: now instead of removing it it's
        contents get converted and added to the document.

      - Issue 942: quotes in links around images broke the public view.

      - Added refresh all to update.

      - Issues 996 and 998: changed image links that pointed to the hires
        version of the image, instead of pointing to <image>/hires_image
        they now point to <image>?hires.

      - Minor problem where the image edit form in the form editor
        didn't recognize a link as one to the hires version of the
        image.

      - Added test cases for get_creation_datetime() and
        get_modification_datetime() in SilvaObject. Also re-enabled and
        revised some tests that were commented out in test_SilvaObject.

      - Indexer is now updated when installation documentation.

  1.0 (release candidate 4)

    Bugs fixed

      - Removed problematic code from index_html Python script that
        accidentally triggered an experimental layout service.

      - Fixed bug in Kupu transformations that broke tables with incomplete
        alignment information.

      - Made the 0.9.3-1.0 Image upgrade a bit more forgiving, which may result
        in broken images but at least lets the upgrade continue.

  1.0 (release candidate 3)

    Bugs fixed

      - Fix bug where published document that is viewed anonymously is
        not accessible.

  1.0 (release candidate 2)

    Features added

      - Silva picks up version from version.txt in more places so that
        less code needs to be updated before each release.

    Bugs fixed

      - Empty index elements [[]] are now longer accepted.

      - Fixed bug in default layout template in accessibility
        (previous/next) links.

      - Closed content is publishable in publish tab.

  1.0 (release candidate 1)

    Features added

      - Kupu, a WYSIWYG editor for Silva Document. This editor offers
        a load of new features:

          - full Silva integration; Kupu knows about special Silva
            elements and saves Silva XML

          - Copy and paste HTML from any source into Kupu.

          - works in Internet Explorer (5.5 and higher) and Mozilla

        Kupu was formerly known as Epoz 1.0.

      - Extensive documentation released along with Silva, and can be
        automatically installed.

      - All images of a Silva Image asset are stored in the filesystem if
        ExtFile is available and the corresponding option is set in
        service_files. Also better support for ExtFile's static serving was
        introduced. service_files allows to convert the storage method of
        all Silva Image assets.

      - Image scaling supports "keep aspect ratio" now. You can scale with
        120x* or *x211 to fix width or height.

      - An Image has a thumbnail now, retrievable via foo.jpg?thumbnail.

      - Cropper tool - Silva now provides facilities for cropping
        images. This tool combines with the scaling possibilities to
        give authors the means to both scale and resize a high
        resolution image to web format.

      - Images can be viewed without the /image at the end (issue
        594), the high resolution version can be retrieved via
        foo.jpg?hires.

      - Supporting a newer, improved version of ExtFile.

      - Performance improvements in contents screen for folders, icon
        presentation, and metadata system.

      - Numerous tweaks in the UI.

      - Revision of the archive file import (i.e. zipfile import)
        functionality. Mimetypes can be registered for specific Asset
        types. The importer will create Assets depending on the mimetype.

      - Silva now should deliver the right mime type for HEAD requests.

    Bugs fixed

      - When run with Python 2.3 in 2.7 (not yet recommended by Infrae
        for Silva 1.0), suppress source code encoding warnings when
        starting up.

      - Another problem with the upgrade code for handling index elements,
        which causes a few of them to be missed, has been repaired.

      - Ghost Folders now can be added by Editors (required Manager role
        previously)

      - Groups are installable as specified in the UI (no more KeyError).

      - The File asset behaves more like the Image asset, where the URL
        to the object now will return the actual data. This obsoletes
        the need for URL's like "path/to/some/file/download'.

      - A long standing problem with occasional InvalidObjectReference
        errors when installing or refreshing Silva should now be
        fixed.

  0.9.3.4

    Bugs fixed

      - A problem in the upgrade code handling index elements in Silva
        Documents was repaired.

  0.9.3.3

    Bugs fixed

      - Smaller bugfixes in the silvaparser.

      - created a new method addAddable on ExtensionRegistry. This makes
        it possible (again) to add classes to Silva without being required
        to name your class the same as the module name (which the
        registerClass method needs). You simply register your class
        the normal way with Zope, and then invoke addAddable for its
        meta type.

      - Fixed acquisition for viewing locally defined roles on Silva
        objects. (For instance: if user1 has editor role on pub1, and not
        on pub2, viewing /pub1/pub2/foo/tab_access shouldn't show user1
        as an editor, and now doesn't).

  0.9.3.2

    Bugs fixed

      - Make render_icon create absolute URLs again for better
        cacheability.

      - Fixed the silva parser where a specific portnumber in the URL
        would not get recognized.

      - Improved link parser for anchors and query fragments.

  0.9.3.1

    Bugs fixed

      - Improvements in the upgrade code, esp. for large databases.

      - Fixed bug in displaying the "allowed" addables.

  0.9.3

    Features Added

      Author visible changes

        - Container objects (e.g. Folder, Publications and the Silva
          Root) now have a title independent of the index document
          inside the container. The title is set during the creation
          of the container and can be changed using the rename button
          in the folder edit- or properties tab.

        - "Container policies" - When creating a new container object
           the author can choose the tpye of the index object being
           created, or not to create an index object at all. The
           options presented can be extended.

        - Import assets from a zipfile now creates Silva Folder for
          the zipfiles's directory structure.

        - Ghosts have a 'get reference' button now.

        - Silva Files now have their icon dependent on the
          content. I.e. you get a pdf icon if you uploaded a pf
          file. Currently there are icons for PDF, Word, Excel and
          PowerPoint.

        - Added GhostFolder: While a ghost haunts a content objects a
          GhostFolder haunts a container.

        - There is a new Link object for creating references to
          external sites that can become part of navigation and TOC.
          This link object redirects to the external site when
          accessed.

        - The Document text markup parser has been rewritten and is
          able to deal with more forms of input properly. There are a
          number of improvements to the way hyperlinks and indexables
          work.

        - New 'annotation' paragraph type.

        - Headings in Silva Documents now allow superscript, subscript
          and emphasis markup.

        - Numerous UI tweaks.

      Chief editor visible changes

        - Added IP Groups. This replaces the 'restriction by IP
          address' text area in tab_access.

        - Added Viewer + and Viewer ++ roles for higher view
          restrictions. Redid the user interface and underlying code
          for setting this.

      Site developer visible changes

        - Deprecated SQL Data Source assets in favor of the
          SilvaExternalSources extension. Existing SQL Data Source
          assets continue to work, but no new SQL Data Sources can be
          added to the Silva tree. In future Silva versions SQL Data
          Source assets may stop working. Add an external source in
          the editor using 'External Source' (not 'External Data',
          which is way to add the deprecrated SQL Data Source assets).

        - Improved virtual hosting support. Both the public screens as
          well as the Silva edit screens should behave better in the
          presence of virtual hosting. Public view caching such as for
          Silva Document has also been made virtual host aware.

        - Documents now index title along with document XML contents
          in fulltext indexing.

        - Error messages in public sites should now be shown within
          the context of the public template (if
          standard_error_message is replaced in the Silva root or if
          a new Silva root is created).

        - Some infrastructure is now in place to drive workflow
          from an outside process like a cron job. This is needed to
          keep the catalog and thus search functionality up to date if
          publication dates are set in the future or expiration dates
          are used.

        - DemoObject is removed from the core in favor of a (to be
          developed/updated) demo extension.

      Technical changes

        - Added API to membership system so that extra columns can be
          defined for lookup results by plugin membership components.

        - Merged silva.css and ploneCustom.css (removed ploneCustom)
          to reduce hits and processing.

        - service_utils went away. All functionality moved to
          mangle.py

        - Checks for valid IDs are all moved to a separate module.

        - Silva Document and editor functionality is split from the
          Silva core into a separate SilvaDocument product. This is
          still very much tied to the core in this release however, so
          changes are noted in this HISTORY file for the time being.

        - Silva Views machinery is split out from the Silva core into
          SilvaViews product.

        - New SilvaExternalSources product replacing both code element
          and SQLSource assets. This makes it possible to pass
          parameters to external sources (a feature missing in code
          element). They also plug into the document caching
          framework.

        - Added functionality to use CMFCore DirectoryView
          infrastructure instead of FileSystemSite, through the
          fssite.py module. Importing from the CMFCore is turned off
          right now, though.

          All uses of FileSystemSite functionality in Silva should now
          import through this module.

        - Errors that are displayed in the Silva user interface now
          don't result in ZODB database commits.

        - A new Silva unit testing framework that is based on the
          ZopeTestCase system
          (http://www.zope.org/Members/shh/ZopeTestCase) allows much
          higher performance and less hackery for running unit tests.
          See the README.txt in the tests directory for more information.

        - publication and modification datetime support is now not
          dependent on ZODB bobobase_modification_datetime anymore but
          is hooked into the metadata system.

    Bugs fixed

        - Fixed rare or edge-case situations in the Publish tab. UI
          improvements, bugfixes and some code optimizations.

        - Renaming publishables no longer changes ordering (issue 635)

        - In the Docma queues, the fullname of the job owner is now
          shown instead of the userid, which was seen as a security
          issue by some customers.

        - Fixed unicode issue when deleting a table column

        - XML export permissions rationalized: it is now accessible to
          people having ReadSilvaContent permission.

        - Access restriction by IP used to rely on Zope Properties;
          this doesn't happen anymore since we migrated to IP groups.

        - Some cleanups in what is indexed in the catalog.

        - Can add a new Silva root with non-ascii (latin1) characters
          in the title.


  0.9.2.6

    Bugs fixed

        - Fulltext also indexes title, not just XML content

        - Fixed some unicode errors in the EmailMessageService.

        - Cache is now bypassed if 'suppress_title' is in the request.

  0.9.2.5

    Features Added

        - Image elements in a Silva Document now have to possibility to
          link to the hires version or other URLs with a optional "_target".

    Bugs fixed

        - No Catalog indexes are created for Metadata fields which do not
          need indexing.

        - Metadata form and acquisition didn't work properly in all cases.

        - UI improvements in tab_edit and tab_publish

        - XML export of folders when the "export last version" option is
          checked, did not use correct Folder title.

        - Fixed two issues with the SQLDataSource and integer fields:
          the code doesn't try to convert the contents of the field to
          unicode anymore if it's not a plain string (fails with
          integers) and the code doesn't change the contents of the
          field to '' anymore when it's something else than None
          (previously it checked whether it resolved to true instead
          of checking for None).

        - View caching should now be more efficient as cachability
          check is now only made once for each new publish event. The
          view caching framework now also has some unit tests.

  0.9.2.4

    Features Added

        - Import assets from a zipfile now creates Silva Folder for the
          zipfiles's directory structure.

    Bugs fixed

        - Fixed bug where the widget caches were not cleared correctly
          upon deletion of a Document.

        - Fixed rare or edge-case situations in the Publish tab. UI
          improvements, bugfixes and some code optimizations.

        - SilvaMetadata contained a bug which actually made metadata
          cataloging fail. This has been fixed in SilvaMetadata
          0.7.2, so the only upgrade necessary is in fact of this
          dependency. For convenience we've also done a new Silva
          release, but the only thing it contains is one new test for
          getting metadata.

  0.9.2.3

    Bugs fixed

        - Authors can now create new document versions again. This was
          a permission setting problem. It can be fixed by going to
          service_extensions and pressing 'refresh' for the Silva
          core.

        - Fixed two issues with the SQLDataSource and integer fields:
          the code doesn't try to convert the contents of the field to
          unicode anymore if it's not a plain string (fails with
          integers) and the code doesn't change the contents of the
          field to '' anymore when it's something else than None
          (previously it checked whether it resolved to true instead
          of checking for None).

        - Fixed a whole host of issues related to indexing. Indexing
          of objects was both done incorrectly and the performance was
          too slow. test_catalog was added which can be used to test
          indexing correctness, and fixes were made where problems
          were found. Indexing performance was increased by:

            * Avoiding indexing something too frequently in the Silva
              core.

            * Improving Formulator so that TALES expressions are
              cached. This avoids a massive Python expression
              compilation overhead. Upgrade Formulator to version
              1.5.0 for a massive boost in indexing performance.

            * Fixing Silva metadata to avoid quadratic behavior while
              indexing. Previously, for n elements that are indexed,
              for each element indexing the data for the n indexes was
              accessed, resulting in quadratic behavior while indexing
              (n * n values were accessed per object). Upgrade SilvaMetadata
              to version 0.7.1 for another boost in indexing performance.

            * Fulltext indexing of unapproved versions is avoided.

            * Old versions should now not show up in the catalog anymore.

        - Fix icon rendering. It should now be faster and more
          browser-cache friendly.

        - Fixed unicode issue when deleting a table column.

        - A number of things fixed in 0.9.1.x have also been fixed
          for 0.9.2.

  0.9.2.2

    Bugs Fixed

        - get CSS style iteration right for containers only containing
          Assets (which otherwise would break the container view).

        - Add a silva root in the ploneCustom style sheet for the
          tabbar background images (which would not display if the
          silva root folder did not have 'silva' for id and be located
          directly in the zope root).

        - Be less aggressive about trying to add a Unicode Whitespace
          splitter, and accept if one is already there.

        - Changed check_reserved_ids() function in the content upgrade
          script from breadth-first to depth-first. This works better for
          content hierarchies where folders with an invalid id containing
          content also with invalid ids, are being renamed.

        - The metadata tab wouldn't show the metadata set's title when it
          was available.

  0.9.2.1

    Features added

        - Added support for ExternalEditor, Silva Files and Images can now
          be edited using your favorite editor

    Bugs Fixed

        - Fix bug where viewing content normally restricted by an
          AccessRestriction, could be viewed via a Ghost.

        - Pressing upgrade more than once now doesn't mess up object titles
          anymore

        - All content types should now have the correct metadata sets setup
          for them (led to a KeyError on 'silva-extra' in all of the views
          of those content types)

  0.9.2

    Features Added

        - Bulk import of files (for File Assets) and/or images (for Image
          Assets) using a zipfile.

        - New metadata architecture, which provides multiple configurable
          metadata sets. Sets can defined on a per object type basis and
          uses the catalog to make this metadata searchable.

        - Unicode support. All content and meta data can contain any character
          defined by the unicode standard. On upgrade you have replace or
          update your index_html set the the correct encoding; the default
          index_html does this.

        - Sidebar caching. For performance reasons, the sidebar is now cached,
          making it possible to use it throughout the site without slowing
          down page rendering.

        - High resolution image support. If you have PIL installed images can
          be both converted to JPEG or PNG and arbitrary scaled for web
          presentation. The high resolution image can be used for printing.

        - Asset references and code element references will now be relative
          paths if the Assets are in the same container the Document is in,
          or in a subcontainer of this container. If not, the path will be
          an absolute path.

        - Docma queue viewer is now on both import and export screen. On import
          only Silva XML files are shown, on export only Word documents.

        - Export screen prefills email address and description.

        - Single Document import/export

        - Markup character escapes (entities)

        - Titles are now associated to document versions, not documents
          themselves. Different versions can have different titles.

        - Some XMLWidgets related cleanups to the editor.

    Bugs Fixed

        - (SQL)Datasources can now only be placed by ChiefEditors and up
          (using a Datasource in a document is not affected by this), and
          (SQL)Datasources now work with unicode.

        - The widgets cache would be cleared correctly upon Document
          deletion. This could result in inconsistent Document editor states
          if this Document has an id earlier held by a Document now deleted.

        - Setting a TOC level would display one level too much.

        - Fixed problems arising from allowing to create content objects
          which may shadow important internal objects (issue321) or
          cause unfriendly Zope error messages (issue189)

        - A number of minor bugs, mainly in UI.

  0.9.1.5

    Features Added

        - Added support for ExternalEditor, Silva Files and Images can
          now be edited using your favorite editor.

        - Bulk import of files (for File Assets) and/or images (for Image
          Assets) using a zipfile. Note though, that the 091 id
          checking is less tolerant compared to the 092 id checking.


    Bugs Fixed

        - Removed "Asset reference" asset-type stickyness.

        - Fixed button for refresh queue when Docma is enabled.

        - Added a find_indexers utility (accesible through
          http://server/silva/edit/service_utils/find_indexers) to find all
          Indexer objects in use.

        - Help text opens in new browser window.

        - Indexer -all non-versioned content actually- can now be deleted.

        - Indexer objects now render the correct URLs in virtual host
          situations. Use the 'update index' in the edit tab of Indexer
          objects to get the Indexers up to date.

        - Setting a TOC level would display one level too much.

        - Pressing 'Export' in Document's status tab now takes a user to the
          export screen of the container so the user can indeed (as the text
          suggests) export to Docma as well as download the content.

  0.9.1.4

    Bugs Fixed

        - The UI for 'Access Restriction by Role' did not properly expose
          the possibility to set this role more restrictive on a lower
          level. (the pull down menu and button would have been disabled).

        - get_public_tree() would not do the right thing with the depth-
          level control argument.

  0.9.1.3

    Features Added

        - Alternating CSS classes in table rows for external data elements.

    Bugs Fixed

        - Fixed situation where authors could not move items to other
          positions in the folders.

        - Fixed bug where no asset could be added in the asset lookup
          dialog when no previous assets where available in this folder.

        - Images nested in tables now keep their <a href="..."> tag (if set
          on the image element).

        - Ghosts of Documents containing a TOC will render this TOC with
          the Ghost's container context and not with the container context
          of the target Document.

        - Fixed unwanted aquisition behaviour of Ghost paths and other
          improvements in the Ghost code.

  0.9.1.2

    Features Added

        - Backport of the Hi-res images support.

        - Backport of the multipe file repositories ability.

        - Backport of single Document import/export.

        - Asset references and code element references will now be relative
          paths if the Assets are in the same container the Document is in,
          or in a subcontainer of this container. If not, the path will be
          an absolute path.

        - Docma queue viewer is now on both import and export screen. On
          import only Silva XML files are shown, on export only Word
          documents.

        - Export screen prefills email address and description.

    Bugs Fixed

        - Fixed some bugs with copy/cut and paste: when an object is not
          allowed somewhere, it's now not possible to paste it there
          anymore, and also the id of the object to be pasted is now
          changed until it's unique (in the past, a bug in creating a
          unique id kept the status of a document 'public' in some cases).

        - Intermediate fix where an local roles mapping for an non-existing
          userid would display "Unknown User" and could not be deleted.

        - Past to ghost of Publications exposed two bugs. Fixed now.

  0.9.1.1

    Bugs Fixed

        - UI bug where the cursor would behave inconsistently when
          hoovering buttons and buttonlinks.

        - Membership now supports member objects that have different ids
          than the userids. This is useful in LDAP setups where the userid
          may contain characters illegal in URLs, such as the @ sign.

        - Edit on pro transformations up to date.

  0.9.1

    Bugs Fixed

        - The "use selection" button would not return to tab_access
          just after assigning a role to a user.

        - Changed from absolute_url(1) to getPhysicalPath() for
          code elements - this should make code elements work in a
          virtual host setup.

        - Datasource parameters store empty strings instead of None
          for default values.

        - Fixed bug where the title of a SQLDatasource Asset was not
          set in the edit tab.

        - Corrected access key in Indexer tabs.

        - Fixed tab_edit where Authors can't move anything and see
          an empty controls row.

        - Adjusted tab_edit and tab_status access key links so they
          work with Mozilla (select lists and checkbox labels).

        - Removed Mozilla incompatibility notes from help (since the
          problems are fixed).

        - Updated layout_macro to match presentation preview link in
          tab_preview.

        - Fixed location of closed message in tab_preview so it shows
          up regardless of which layout (public or default) gets used.
          Aligned presentation preview link better in default layout.

        - Fix where the Groups administration button was shown, even
          if no service_groups was available.

        - Now refreshes all installed products before an
          "upgrade all" action.

        - Fixed bug where a new connection id was not updated correctly
          on the SQL Datasource Asset

        - Indexer objects now show up in public table of contents always
          if placed (before they never did).

        - File assets could only be added by users with manager role;
          this now only requires an Author role.

        - A memory leak exists in Zope 2.5.1 that is exposed by Silva in
          some cases when using the SMI. Zope 2.6.1 appears to fix this
          memory leak. Note though that while Zope 2.6.1 appears to work
          with Silva, we haven't done extensive testing...

        - Fixed bug which cause the upgrade of all content to crash on
          CatalogedVersionedContent objects (e.g. SilvaNews NewsItems)

        - Chief editors could not add Groups or Virtual groups due to
          incorrect security settings; fixed.

  0.9.1 beta

    Features Added

        - Soft breaks in paragraphs (single enter).

        - Small API on Silva Root (add_silva_addable_forbidden() and
          clear_silva_addables_forbidden()) for absolutely forbidding
          visibility of certain meta_types in SMI. See also IRoot.py.

        - Improved tab_access user interface.

        - Group and VirtualGroup objects. Can be managed by going to
          'Group Administration' if Group product is installed. This
          makes group management a lot easier.

        - Optional message service ('service_message') which will send
          email on some workflow events.

        - Membership system. Different membership policies (working
          for instance with LDAP) can be plugged into Silva and
          enabled by placing a different Member Service
          ('service_members').

        - Access request system. A new UI so that users who do not
          have permissions to access a place can request roles on
          objects (optional).

        - New 'Data Source' is now enabled by default. The first
          implementation is an 'SQL Data Source' Asset. This can be
          used to import data from a relational database into a
          Document using the 'external data' element.

        - List titles have been removed and transformed into headings.

        - 'image_path' has been renamed to 'path' in the XML.

   Bugs Fixed

        - Fix where the "/manage" display link in the SMI tabs didn't
          didn't regard the local roles on the current object.

        - Asset reference fix where it didn't work in virtual host
          setups.

        - Fix some unicode issue related to tables (issue184)

        - Silva does no longer display non-installed content types
          in list of addables (issue159).

        - Modification time of assets should now be updated properly
          (issue147).

        - Some characters that were removed by the Silva editor
          shouldn't be removed -- made these work (issue 176).

        - New ('add') button should work properly again (issue 162).

        - Invalid image references now properly display error message
          (issue 204).

  0.9.0.3

    Bugs Fixed

      - Merge from HEAD for add new object UI in tab-edit.

      - Fix where the "/manage" display link in the SMI tabs didn't
        regard the local roles on the current object.

      - Unicode fix for table rendering. Merge from HEAD branch.

      - Fix for asset reference to make it works in virtual host
        setups.

  0.9.0.2

    Bugs Fixed

      - When using LDAPUserManagement, a Attribute error on '_getOb'
        occured when adding Silva Images and -Files.

  0.9.0.1

    Bugs Fixed

      - After deleting a finished DocmaServer job, you are redirected
        to an existing page.

      - The (still disabled) externaldata element was registered wrong
        when enabled; fixed this (if you uncomment the code to enable it).

  0.9

    Features Added

        - Can change publication to folder and the reverse.

        - Links in editor now can have a 'target' option.

        - Images can now be hyperlinks.

        - Implementation of DataSource/DataElement for testing.

        - 'Code element' that can call arbitrary code included.

        - Access keys for common form buttons.

        - Integration of RealObjects editor (beta).

        - XML can be exported and imported.

        - Docma integration for importing/exporting to other document
          formats (like MS Word). This feature needs the separate
          Docma server (not yet released).

    Bugs Fixed

        - All '__index__.py' files are now non-empty, so that WinZip
          actually unpacks them...

        - Table edit bug fixed.

        - Table rendering code cleanup, better use of CSS

        - Memory leak fixed (really in ParsedXML and XMLWidgets).

        - Lookup screen now accepts searches for people with names only
          2 characters big.

        - Lists with style no bullets are now rendered with p tag.

        - Pasted ghosts now obtain a last author.

        - Indexer is now addable by editor and up (used to be
          manager only). Added note in UI that indexer works for published
          content only. Also fixed a bug in the Indexer; it now
          also indexes 'index' (default) documents.

        - Demo index document gets automatically added to new Silva root.

        - 'Authorized users below this level' moved to sub screen of
          access, to make container tab_metadata scale better (this
          could be very slow on large sites).

        - Tweaked LDAPUserFolder.py so it works with more recent versions
          of LDAPUserFolder.

        - Fixed problem in the Access tab, where the user lookup sometimes
          lost the current selection.

  0.8.6.1

       - Added easier way to add references to files, images. Can now
         also reference assets not in local folder.

         for the editors.

       - Added new definition list element.

       - Images now have various alignment options.

       - Moved views, widgets and other support folders to the
         filesystem, now using FileSystemSite.

       - Created new view registry called MultiViewRegistry which
         can deal with views from multiple Silva extension packages.
         View code can be maintained in extension packages apart from
         the Silva core.

       - Created installation framework for Silva extension packages.
         'service_extensions' allows site managers to install new
         extension packages into a Silva install.

       - Beginnings of Silva XML import infrastructure.

    Bugs fixed

       - Changed some permissions so it's possible to display some

      - Added file object.

    Bugs fixed

      - Non existing "tab" for an object, redirects to default tab
      ("tab_edit").

      - Restriction on single column tables removed.

      - Various character encoding related issues.

      - Removed non functional button from "tab_publish".

      - List title attribute migrated to title element in lists (the
      upgrade scripts from 0.8.4 to 0.8.5 will upgrade all content
      containing lists to this new XML format).

      - Display an informational message, if some view is not properly
      registered

        local roles and managed from Silva. The groups system is only
        enabled if the optional Groups product is installed.

      - Improved object rename functionality; multiple items can now
        be renamed in one go.

      - More XML export options; XML can now be exported with or
        without sub publication. It is also possible to export the
        newest version of content instead of the public version.

      - Refactored Silva (API) Interfaces into separate files.

    Bugs Fixed

      - Less restrictive object id validation (underscore and period
        is allowed).

      - "addables" list is now sorted.

      - Paste as ghost for a folder now also ghosts the index.
