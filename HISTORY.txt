Silva changes

  0.8.4

    Features Added

      - A Silva File object to store arbitrary file in either ZODB or on
        the filesystem.

      - Improved Access tab user interface.

      - First implementation of group access. Groups can be assigned
        local roles and managed from Silva. The groups system is only
        enabled if the optional Groups product is installed.

      - Improved object rename functionality; multiple items can now
        be renamed in one go.

      - More XML export options; XML can now be exported with or
        without sub publication. It is also possible to export the
        newest version of content instead of the public version.

      - Refactored Silva (API) Interfaces into separate files.

    Bugs Fixed

      - Less restrictive object id validation (underscore and period
        is allowed).

      - "addables" list is now sorted.

      - Paste as ghost for a folder now also ghosts the index.

      - many small UI tweaks and bugfixes.
