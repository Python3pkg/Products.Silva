The tabs have numbered access keys, starting from one (the first tab) going up to five. You can navigate horizontally accross an item's tabs by using alt-1, alt-2, and so forth. 
</p>
<p class="leadedbody">
Each tab has a top link (the tall tree on the left side, which takes you to the top of the current publication, within the same tab 'vein'). The access key is the shift character of the corresponding number (on the English keyboard, sorry if you have an international one). Thus alt-!, alt-@, alt-#, alt-$, and alt-% (note that the characters resemble the number).
</p>
<p class="leadedbody">
On the right of each tab is an uplink (the small tree, which takes you up one level in the same vein). The access keys for the uplinks are the remaining numbers (add five to the access key for the tab). If you are  in a screen with five tabs, the uplinks are alt-6, alt-7, alt-8, alt-9, and alt-0. (If there are less than five tabs, you still add five to get the uplink key.)

<h3>Other screens</h3>

<p class="leadedbody">
The Metadata, Access, and Status screens as well as their subscreens (such as Lookup, Import, and Export) have access keys for most buttons. Usually the first letter of the button is the access key. You can always hover over the button to see the tool tip. Sometimes there are multiples of the same button, in which case only the first has an access key. 
</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ul class="tips">
<li>
Some access keys can conflict with browser menus. However the key works if the focus is in the page (a form element is active or just click in the page).
</li>
<li>
Mozilla and Internet Explorer handle access keys for hyperlinks differently. Mozilla initiates the action (same as clicking the link), whereas Explorer just highlights the link, and then you have to hit return to activate it. Both browsers treat form buttons the same, initiating the action immediately.
</li>
<li>
Don't forget that most browsers use alt-left arrow to go back, and alt-right arrow to go forward.
</li>
</ul>

<p class="leadedbody">
<span class="subhead">Tip for Mozilla/Netscape users</span><br />
Using the Find As You Type feature will make keyboard navigation to hyperlinks - such as object names - remarkably easy. See:<br />

<h2>Installing documentation for Silva</h2>

<p class="leadedbody">
The most up to date documentation can be read at:<br />
<a href="http://www.infrae.com/products/silva/docs">http://www.infrae.com/products/silva/docs</a>
</p>
<p class="leadedbody">
If you are working offline, documentation can also be installed 'here'. Here is in the 'globals' folder, which is on the file system. If you wish to install docs (your own or Silva documentation), you should put them elsewhere, since 'globals' will be overwritten in an upgrade.
</p>
<p class="leadedbody">
In Zope, create a folder in the Silva root (we'll call it 'help' in this example). Put the documentation in it, and then change the <tt>help_url</tt> property in the Silva root. Go to the Silva instance in the ZMI and click the properties tab and (assuming your Silva instance is called 'silva') change the <tt>help_url</tt> property to:<br />
<tt>/silva/help</tt>
</p>
<p class="leadedbody">
Documentation (in web structured text format) can be found at:
<a href="http://www.infrae.com/products/silva/docs/SilvaDocumentation.tar.gz">http://www.infrae.com/products/silva/docs/SilvaDocumentation.tar.gz</a>
</p>
<p class="leadedbody">
The same documentation is included in the Silva product download in 'plain' structured text, gracefully degraded for text mode (no links, unicode entities, etc.).
