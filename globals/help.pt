Documentation can be installed here.

Here is in the 'globals' folder, and if you wish to install docs, 
(your own or Silva documentation) you should put them elsewhere, 
since globals will be overwritten in an upgrade.

If you have a 'locals' folder, add a folder called 'help' there, 
put the documentation in it, and then change a property in the 
Silva root. Go to the top of Silva in the ZMI and click the 
properties tab and change the help_url property to: 
  /silva/locals/help

Documentation (in structured text format) can be found at:

Silva access keys
=================
+ The access key on your system may be 'alt' or something else.
+ Hover over the link or button to see a tool tip with the key.
+ Some access keys can conflict with browser menus. However the 
  key works if the focus is in the page (a form element is active 
  or just click in the page).

Global keys that are always available
-------------------------------------
General
  t Jump to top of page
  b Jump to bottom of page
  / Jump to top of Silva (Silva icon)
  h Help

The tabs have numbered access keys, starting from one (the first 
tab) going up to five. You can navigate horizontally accross the 
tabs by using alt-1, alt-2, and so forth. 

Each tab has a top link (the tall tree on the left side, which 
takes you to the top of the current publication, within the
same tab 'vein'). The access key is the shift character of the 
corresponding number (on the English keyboard, sorry if you have 
an international one). Thus alt-!, alt-@, alt-#, alt-$, and alt-% 
(note that the characters resemble the number).

On the right of each tab is an uplink (the small tree, which
takes you up one level in the same vein). The access keys for the 
uplinks are the remaining numbers (add five to the access key for 
the tab). If you are  in a screen with five tabs, the uplinks are 
alt-6, alt-7, alt-8, alt-9, and alt-0. (If there are less than 
five tabs, you still add five to get the uplink key.)

Other screens
-------------
The Metadata, Access, and Status screens as well as their
subscreens (such as Lookup, Import, and Export) have access 
keys for most buttons (sometimes there are multiples of the 
same button, in which case only the first has an access key). 
Usually the first letter of the button is the access key. 
You can always hover over the button to see the tool tip. 


Don't forget that most browsers use alt-left arrow to go
back, and alt-right arrow to go forward.
