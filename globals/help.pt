Documentation can be installed here.

Here is in the 'globals' folder, and if you wish to install docs, 
(your own or Silva documentation) you should put them elsewhere, 
since globals will be overwritten in an upgrade.

If you have a 'locals' folder, add a folder called 'help' there, 
put the documentation in it, and then change a property in the 
Silva root. Go to the top of Silva in the ZMI and click the 
properties tab and change the help_url property to: 
/silva/locals/help

Documentation (in structured text format) can be found at:
<a href="http://www.infrae.com/products/silva/docs">http://www.infrae.com/products/silva/docs</a>
