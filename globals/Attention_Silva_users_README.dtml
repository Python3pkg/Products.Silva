This folder ('/globals') contains Silva specific items, and *will* be overwritten in 
an upgrade.

If you have created similar items, we suggest making a 'locals' folder, and storing 
them there.

The folder '/images' is meant for images which are in use for (your) public layouts. 
It will not be overwritten in an upgrade.
