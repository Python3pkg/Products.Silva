Installing Silva

  Silva depends on a set of file-system Python products for Zope for
  its core functionality, as well as a set of services which are
  stored in the Zope Object Database for the particular look & feel of
  the system.

  These Silva products come as .tgz files, and need to be unpacked in
  the Zope's lib/python/Products directory. Restart Zope after
  unpacking to finish the installation.

  Silva Filesystem Products

    Silva (0.8)

      Silva implements the behavior for the Silva objects, such as
      Folders, Publications, and Documents. Also implements some basic
      functionality for the editing of Silva documents.
  
      The Silva product can be found here:

        "Silva":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/Silva

      or just download:

        "Silva-0.8.tgz":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/Silva/Silva-0.8.tgz
  
    XMLWidgets (0.8)

      A system that builds on top of ParsedXML to assist in the
      rendering of editor, as well as in the generation of the HTML
      for the public pages.

      XMLWidgets can be found here:

        "XMLWidgets":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/XMLWidgets

      or just download:

        "XMLWidgets-0.8.tgz":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/XMLWidgets/XMLWidgets-0.8.tgz

    ParsedXML (1.3.0)

      A system that allows the storage of XML documents in the Zope
      Object Database. Allows DOM access as well as ways to construct
      references to individual nodes. Silva Document and Silva Course
      use this to store their data.

      ParsedXML depends on the PyXML library for some of its
      operation; the Python interpreter that is used to run Zope must
      have access to a recent version of PyXML (0.7 and up should
      work).

      ParsedXML can be found here:
 
        "ParsedXML":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/ParsedXML

      or just download:

        "ParsedXML-1.3.0.tgz":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/ParsedXML/ParsedXML-1.3.0.tgz
   
    Formulator (1.2.0)

      A system for the construction and validation of web forms, used
      by Silva's views.

      Formulator can be found here:

        "Formulator":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/Formulator

      or just download:

        "Formulator-1.2.0.tgz":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/Formulator/Formulator-1.2.0.tgz

  Silva services (ZODB)

    service_view_registry

      Page templates and python scripts to determine the look & feel
      of the Silva objects, both in edit mode and also for their
      public/preview mode. This uses the Silva product.

    service_widgets and editor/viewer/previewer services

      These objects define the actual editors and (prev)viewers of
      Silva Documents and Silva Courses. This uses the XMLWidgets
      product.

    These services are contained in a Silva Root object; this will
    also contain the Silva content when it is added by the
    authors. The Silva root object also defines various properties and
    security settings needed by Silva, and some demo objects.

    Silva is packaged as a .zexp file, which can be imported into Zope
    after installing the filesystem products previously listed.

    You can find it here:

      "Silva":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/Silva

    or just download:

      "silva-0.8.zexp.gz":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/Silva/silva-0.8.zexp.gz

    First unpack 'silva-0.8.zexp.gz' to get a 'silva-0.8.zexp'
    file. Then place this in your Zope's 'import' directory, and then
    import it through the Zope management interface into your Zope's
    root. This can be done by using the 'import/export' button on the
    Zope's management screen. Silva currently expects to be installed
    directly under the Zope root and is named 'silva', but it should
    be possible to change this by altering some properties in the
    Silva root.

  Installing Silva with LDAP support

    Silva can work together with LDAPUserFolder so that users in an
    LDAP database can be looked up and authorized as Silva authors and
    editors. In order to do enable this, add and configure a
    LDAPUserFolder in your Silva root (as acl_users). Then go to the
    file UserManagement.py in the lib/python/Products/Silva directory,
    and change UserManagement.py to contain the line::

      from LDAPUserManagement import user_management

    and comment out this line::

      from SimpleUserManagement import user_management

    and then restarting Zope to make these changes take effect.

  Installing Silva on a ZEO cluster

    In this case, the products need to be installed for all nodes of
    the cluster. For LDAP support, the above change needs to be made
    in all installations of the Silva product. For importing the
    .zexp, put a copy of 'silva.zexp' in the 'import' directory of all
    cluster nodes.
 
    Since Silva depends heavily on sessions, these also need to be
    shared throughout the cluster; this can be done by mounting a
    non-undoable storage into the main storage that will be used
    specifically as a store for session data. For more information on
    this, see 'doc/zeo_cluster_notes'.
