Installing Silva

Silva depends on a set of file-system Python products for Zope for
its core functionality, as well as a set of services which are stored
in the Zope Object Database for the particular look & feel of the
system.

Core Silva Zope Products

  Silva

    Silva implements the behavior for the Silva objects, such as
    Folders, Publications, and Documents. Also implements some basic
    functionality for the editing of Silva documents.
  
  XMLWidgets

    A system that builds on top of ParsedXML to assist in the
    rendering of editor, as well as in the generation of the HTML for
    the public pages.

  These Silva products come as .tgz files, and need to be unpacked in
  the Zope's lib/python/Products directory, and then restart Zope.

Dependencies

  ParsedXML

    A system that allows the storage of XML documents in the Zope
    Object Database. Allows DOM access as well as ways to construct
    references to individual nodes. Silva Document and Silva Course
    use this to store their data.

    ParsedXML depends on the PyXML library for some of its operation;
    the Python interpreter that is used to run Zope must have access
    to a recent version of PyXML (0.7 and up should work).

  Formulator

    A system for the construction and validation of web forms, used by
    Silva's views.

  These products, like the core products, come as .tgz files, and need
  to be unpacked in the Zope's lib/python/Products directory, and then
  restart Zope.

Silva services (ZODB)

  service_view_registry

    Page templates and python scripts to determine the look & feel of
    the Silva objects, both in edit mode and also for their
    public/preview mode. This uses the Silva product.

  service_widgets and editor/viewer services

    These objects define the actual editors and viewers of Silva
    Documents and Silva Courses. This uses XMLWidgets.

  These services are contained in a Silva Root object; this will also
  contain the Silva content when it is added by the authors. It is
  packaged as a silva.zexp file, which can be imported into Zope after
  installing the previous products. Place the silva.zexp in your
  Zope's 'import' directory, and then import this through the Zope
  management interface into your Zope's root. This can be done by
  using the 'import/export' button on the Zope's management screen.

Installing Silva with LDAP support

  Silva can work together with LDAPUserFolder so that users in an LDAP
  database can be looked up and authorized as Silva authors and
  editors. In order to do enable this, add and configure a
  LDAPUserFolder in your Silva root (as acl_users). Then go to the file
  UserManagement.py in the lib/python/Products/Silva directory, and
  change UserManagement.py to contain the line::

    from LDAPUserManagement import user_management

  and comment out this line::

    from SimpleUserManagement import user_management

  and then restarting Zope to make these changes take effect.

Installing Silva on a ZEO cluster

  In this case, the products need to be installed for all nodes of the
  cluster. For LDAP support, the above change needs to be made in all
  installations of the Silva product. For importing the .zexp, put a
  copy of 'silva.zexp' in the 'import' directory of all cluster nodes.
 
  Since Silva depends heavily on sessions, these also need to be
  shared throughout the cluster; this can be done by mounting a
  non-undoable storage into the main storage that will be used
  specifically as a store for session data. [see other document]
