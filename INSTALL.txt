Installing Silva

  NOTE: If you are upgrading from a previous version of Silva, please
  see "UPGRADE.txt":http://www.zope.org/Members/infrae/Silva/UPGRADE.txt

  If you have problems installing Silva, please consult
  TROUBLESHOOTING.txt.

  Silva depends on a set of file-system Python products for Zope for
  its core functionality. There will also be a number of services
  installed in the Zope Object Database; since release 0.8.6 this
  takes place automatically from the filesystem.

  These Silva products come as .tgz files, and need to be unpacked in
  the Zope's Products directory (usually
  [path/to/Zope]/lib/python/Products or [path/to/instancehome]/Products).
  Restart Zope after unpacking to finish the installation.

  After this restart you should have a bunch of Silva objects in your
  Zope add list. Pick 'Silva Root' and add it (for instance to your
  Zope root). This should now automatically create a Silva instance
  with services and so on installed. If you go to
  'http://yourzope/yoursilva/edit' you will see the Silva Management
  Interface.

  If you ever install a Silva extension, go to the
  'service_extensions' service in your Silva root using the Zope
  management screens. You should see the extension listed and you can
  install it into that Silva instance using the 'install' button.

  Silva Requirements (install in your Products directory)

    Silva (1.0)

      Silva implements the behavior for the Silva objects, such as
      Folders, Publications, and Documents. Also implements some
      basic functionality for the editing of Silva documents. Since
      version 0.8.6 this also contains the views and widgets in
      separate subdirectories.
  
      The Silva product can be found here:

        "Silva":http://www.zope.org/Members/infrae/Silva

      Also available there is a "all" tarball, which includes all required
      Products for a Silva setup (but not including Groups, ExtFile, 
      SilvaExternalSources and LDAP integration code).

    SilvaViews (0.9)

      The infrastructure used by Silva to attach views to content objects.

        "SilvaViews":http://www.zope.org/Members/infrae/SilvaViews

    Formulator (1.6.2)

      A system for the construction and validation of web forms, used
      by Silva's views.

      Formulator can be found here:

        "Formulator":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/Formulator

    FileSystemSite (1.4) - not released yet at the time writing, but
    included in the "all" tarball.

      A system for keeping PageTemplates, PythonScripts and so on on
      the filesystem. This allows us to maintain the view code for
      Silva on the filesystem, which should make both version control
      and deployment easier.

      FileSystemSite can be found here:

        "FileSystemSite":http://www.zope.org/Members/philikon/FileSystemSite

    SilvaMetadata (0.7.6)

      Silva Metadata can be used to create metadata sets and
      associate these with Zope object types. The metadata can be
      configured to be cataloged automatically. It is integrated with
      Silva (since version 0.9.2) and has a CMF compatibility layer.

      SilvaMetadata can be found here:

        "SilvaMetadata":http://www.zope.org/Members/infrae/SilvaMetadata

    ProxyIndex (1.1.2)

      ProxyIndex is a plugin catalog index. It uses a TALES
      expression instead of an attribute lookup/call to retrieve the
      value to index from an object. The value retrieved can then be
      indexed by any available plugin index.

      ProxyIndex can be found here:

        "ProxyIndex":http://www.zope.org/Members/infrae/ProxyIndex

    Annotations (0.4.3)

      Annotations is a generic way to add information to arbitrary
      Zope objects. It is used by Silva Metadata to store metadata.

      Annotations can be found here:

        "Annotations":http://www.zope.org/Members/infrae/Annotations

    SilvaDocument (1.0)

      Silva Document contains the functionality implementing the Silva
      Document object and editor. It is optional, but in order to do
      something useful with Silva out of the box, this needs to be
      installed.

      SilvaDocument can be found here:

        "SilvaDocument":http://www.zope.org/Members/infrae/SilvaDocument

    XMLWidgets (0.10.3)

      A system that builds on top of ParsedXML to assist in the
      rendering of editor, as well as in the generation of the HTML
      for the public pages.

      XMLWidgets can be found here:

        "XMLWidgets":http://www.zope.org/Members/infrae/XMLWidgets

    ParsedXML (1.3.1)

      A system that allows the storage of XML documents in the Zope
      Object Database. Allows DOM access as well as ways to construct
      references to individual nodes. Silva Document uses this to
      store its data.

      ParsedXML depends on the PyXML library for some of its
      operation; the Python interpreter that is used to run Zope must
      have access to a recent version of PyXML (0.7 works. 0.8.1
      should also work, but let us know!).

      ParsedXML can be found here:
 
        "ParsedXML":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/ParsedXML

    Groups (0.4)

      If you want to take advantage of Groups support, please
      download and install the Groups product, here:
  
       "Groups":http://www.zope.org/Members/infrae/Groups

      Groups support is optional; Silva should run without the Groups
      product installed. Groups use a rather hackish technique called
      'monkey patching' to hook groups support into the Silva core,
      and this may conflict with other products that do the same. If
      you get strange behavior, removing the Groups product and
      restarting Zope will safely remove it.

      To start using the Groups definitions, a "Groups Service" is
      needed. Once the Groups Filesystem Product is installed, such a
      service can be added to the Silva Root via the ZMI. This
      service should have 'service_groups' for its id.

    SilvaExternalSources (0.2)

      If this is installed, Silva Documents gain functionality to 
      include data coming from external sources into itself. This
      replaces the code source and SQL Data Source functionality.
  
      SilvaExternalSources can be downloaded from here:
      
        http://www.zope.org/Members/infrae/SilvaExternalSources
        
    ExtFile (1.2.0)

      If you plan to manage large upload files with Silva, which
      should not be stored in the ZODB but the plain file system, you
      may consider installing the ExtFile product from here:

        "ExtFile":http://zope.org/Members/shh/ExtFile/1.2.0/ExtFile-1.2.0.tar.gz
       
      This product is optional; see "Installing Silva with ExtFile"
      below. You may want to look into the README.txt of ExtFile at
      installation time, and possibly adapt the undo handling. (This
      should not be changed afterwards.)

  Installing Silva with LDAP support

    Silva can work together with LDAPUserFolder (1.2 at this point in
    time has been tested) so that users in an LDAP database can be
    looked up and authorized as Silva authors and editors.

    To make Silva integrate well with a particular LDAP server with a
    particular schema, a separate Member extension product must be
    created for your site that pulls its information from LDAP. At
    the moment we don't have a demo of this available yet, but we
    will try to put one online soon.
 
  Installing Silva with ExtFile support.

    If the ExtFile product is properly installed, Silva can use it to
    store Silva File objects in the file system instead of the ZODB.
    To let Silva use the ExtFile product, you can change settings
    using the service_files object available in the services tab in
    the Silva root.

    Note that enabling/disabling ExtFile storage does not change the
    storage of the already present Silva File objects. It has no
    effect to the Silva Image objects either, as they are stored in
    the ZODB in any case. More information is available in the
    'docs/FileObject.stx'.

  Installing Silva on a ZEO cluster

    Since Silva depends heavily on sessions, these also need to be
    shared throughout the cluster; this can be done by mounting a
    non-undoable storage into the main storage that will be used
    specifically as a store for session data.

    For more information on this, see 'docs/ZeoClusterNotes.stx' and
    'docs/ZeoClusterNotes2.stx'.
