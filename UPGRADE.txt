Upgrading from 0.8.5 and below

  Please upgrade your Silva to 0.8.6.1 first. Be careful to read its
  upgrade instructions! You can find Silva 0.8.6.1 here:

  "Silva 0.8.6.1":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/Silva/Silva-0.8.6.1.tgz

Upgrading Silva 0.8.6.x to 0.9

  This document applies to upgrading Silva only; if you are newly
  installing Silva please look at 'INSTALL.txt'.

  NOTE: It makes of course sense to make a backup of Silva before
  trying to upgrade!

  Silva Filesystem Products

    In order to upgrade to 0.9 you need a new version of Silva (0.9),
    Formulator (1.3.1), ParsedXML (1.3.1) and XMLWidgets
    (0.8.4). Download the new versions here:

      * "Silva-0.9.tgz":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/Silva/Silva-0.9.tgz
  
      * "Formulator-1.3.1.tgz":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/Formulator/Formulator-1.3.1.tgz

      * "ParsedXML-1.3.1.tgz":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/ParsedXML/ParsedXML-1.3.1.tgz

      * "XMLWidgets-0.8.4.tgz":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/XMLWidgets/XMLWidgets-0.8.4.tgz
    
    To upgrade, remove the Silva, Formulator, ParsedXML and XMLWidgets
    directories from your 'Products' directory first. Then unpack the
    new files you downloaded.

    FileSystemSite does not have to be upgraded for this upgrade. Groups
    also does not require an upgrade.

    If you are using Silva's LDAP support (turned off by default), you
    should consult the section in 'INSTALL.txt' to see how to
    configure the newly installed Silva product to use this again.

    If you are using Silva's ExtFile support (turned off by default),
    you should consult the section in 'INSTALL.txt' to see how to
    configure the newly installed Silva product to use this again.

    Restart Zope to make the new product code take effect. Now go on
    to the next step.

  Refreshing the Silva product

    After the restart, go to 'service_extensions' in the Silva Root as
    Zope manager and click the 'refresh' button for the 'Silva'
    product. This lets Silva update various configurations in the Zope
    object database. 

    You should be done upgrading now!
 
  Page templates for presentation of public views
    
    The upgrade will likely carry new default versions of the page
    templates and style sheets used for presentation of the public
    website. You can install these examples in your Silva root by
    going to 'service_extensions' in the Silva Root and pressing the
    'install default layout' button.

    Doing this won't overwrite your public layout code; the only thing
    overwritten will be whatever in the current 'default_' objects, if
    any exist. You can then look at this code for examples. If you're
    satisfied with their contents you can also rename them to versions
    without the 'default_' prefix and start using them.
 
  Upgrading Custom Content Types.

    If you have custom content types in a separate Zope Product,
    you will need to export the views in the 'service_view_registry' to
    the file system and register them with the new views structure.
    There is detailed information about how to achieve this
    in the docs/Filesystem.stx
