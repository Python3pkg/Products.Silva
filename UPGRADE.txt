  Valid for:  Silva 0.9.1 beta
  Author:     Martijn Faassen

  CVS:        $Revision: 1.24 $
 
Upgrading from 0.8.6 and below

  Please upgrade your Silva to 0.9 first. Be careful to read its
  upgrade instructions! You can find Silva 0.9 here:

  "Silva 0.9.0.4":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/Silva/Silva-0.9.0.4.tgz

  Please read the UPGRADE.txt included with that release.

Upgrading Silva 0.9.0.x to 0.9.1

  This document applies to upgrading Silva only; if you are newly
  installing Silva please look at 'INSTALL.txt'.

  NOTE: It makes of course sense to make a backup of Silva before
  trying to upgrade!

  Silva Filesystem Products

    In order to upgrade to 0.9.1 you need a new version of Silva
    (0.9.1) and FileSystemSite (1.2). Download them here:

      * "Silva-0.9.1b.tgz":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/Silva/Silva-0.9.1b.tgz
  
      * "FileSystemSite-1.2.tgz":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/Silva/FileSystemSite-1.2.tgz

    The latter is a temporary location, it should be downloadable here
    soon:

      * "FileSystemSite-1.2.tgz":http://www.zope.org/Members/k_vertigo/Products/FileSystemSite

    If you are using Groups, you also need to download and install the
    new Groups 0.3. Find it here:

      * "Groups-0.3.tgz":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/Groups/Groups-0.3.tgz

    To upgrade, remove the Silva, FileSystemSite and (if you have it)
    Groups directories from your 'Products' directory first. Then
    unpack the new files you downloaded.

    Formulator, XMLWidgets and ParsedXML do not require an upgrade in
    this release.

    Note that LDAP integration of Silva has changed with the new
    membership system. If you are using LDAP integration with your
    Silva, you will notice that the old system has disappeared. In its
    stead we have a new member extension mechanism that takes it
    place. If you need help enabling membership please contact
    Infrae. We will place a demo membership extension that uses LDAP
    online soon.

    If you are using Silva's ExtFile support (turned off by default),
    you should consult the section in 'INSTALL.txt' to see how to
    configure the newly installed Silva product to use this again.

    Restart Zope to make the new product code take effect. Now go on
    to the next step.

  Refreshing and upgrading the Silva product

    If you are upgrading from 0.9 to 0.9.1, you need to upgrade the
    content of Silva, as some of the structures have changed. After
    the restart, go to 'service_extensions' in the Silva Root as Zope
    manager and click the 'upgrade' button. This will automatically
    refresh all installed Silva extensions as well as upgrade the
    Silva content that needs upgrading.

    If you are upgrading a minor version (beta to final, for instance)
    it should be enough to just press the 'Refresh all' button to
    upgrade. This lets Silva update various configurations in the Zope
    object database.

    You should be done upgrading now!
 
  Page templates for presentation of public views
    
    The upgrade will likely carry new default versions of the page
    templates and style sheets used for presentation of the public
    website. You can install these examples in your Silva root by
    going to 'service_extensions' in the Silva Root and pressing the
    'install default layout' button.

    Doing this won't overwrite your public layout code; the only thing
    overwritten will be whatever in the current 'default_' objects, if
    any exist. You can then look at this code for examples. If you're
    satisfied with their contents you can also rename them to versions
    without the 'default_' prefix and start using them.
 
  Upgrading Custom Content Types.

    If you have custom content types in a separate Zope Product,
    you will need to export the views in the 'service_view_registry' to
    the file system and register them with the new views structure.
    There is detailed information about how to achieve this
    in the docs/Filesystem.stx
