Upgrading Silva 0.8.3 to 0.8.4

  This document applies to upgrading Silva only; if you are newly
  installing Silva please look at 'INSTALL.txt'.

  NOTE: It makes of course sense to make a backup of Silva before
  trying to upgrade!

  NOTE: We have not tested an upgrade from 0.8 to 0.8.4 directly; 
  things may break if you try. To be safe you could first upgrade 
  0.8 to 0.8.3 before upgrading to 0.8.4 (see the instructions in
  Silva 0.8.3 for more information).

  Silva Filesystem Products

    First you need to upgrade the underlying Silva product. Download
    the new version here:

      * "Silva-0.8.4.tgz":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/Silva/Silva-0.8.4.tgz
  
    The other required products (XMLWidgets, Formulator and ParsedXML)
    do not have to be updated.

    To upgrade the Silva product, first remove the 'Silva' and
    directory in your Zope's Products directory (usually this is
    'lib/python/Products' in your Zope install). Now unpack
    'Silva-0.8.4.tgz'.

    If you are using Silva's LDAP support (turned off by default), you
    should consult the section in 'INSTALL.txt' to see how to
    configure the newly Silva product to use this again.

    Restart Zope to make the new product code to take effect.

  Groups support

    If you want to take advantage of Groups support, please download and
    install the Groups product, here:
  
       * "Groups-0.1.tgz":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/Groups/Groups-0.1.tgz

    Groups support is optional; Silva should run without the Groups
    product installed. Groups use a rather hackish technique called
    'monkey patching' to hook groups support into the Silva core, and
    this may conflict with other products that do the same. If you get
    strange behavior, removing the Groups product and restarting Zope
    will safely remove it.

    To start using the Groups definitions, a "Groups Service" is needed.
    Once the Groups Filesystem Product is installed, such a service can be
    added to the Silva Root via the ZMI. This service should have
    'service_groups' for its id.

  Silva services (ZODB)
    
    Next, you need 'silva_upgrade_0.8.4.zexp.gz', which can be found
    here:

      * "silva_upgrade_0.8.4.zexp.gz":http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/Silva/silva_upgrade_0.8.4.zexp.gz

    You do not need 'silva-0.8.4.zexp.gz', as you are upgrading, not
    installing from scratch.

    Unpack 'silva_upgrade_0.8.4.zexp.gz' and place it in your Zope's
    'import' directory. Now import it into the same folder where you
    installed silva previously (i.e as a sibling to the silva root,
    not into the silva root itself). Usually this means importing it
    into your Zope's root, if you installed silva there.

    You should now have a folder 'silva_upgrade_0.8.4'. This folder
    contains a script to upgrade your Silva install, called
    'upgrade_from_0.8.3_to_0.8.4'. If you want to know in detail what
    it does before executing it, see the section below.

    Enter the 'silva_upgrade_0.8.4' folder and execute the script
    'upgrade_from_0.8.3_to_0.8.4', by going to its 'Test' tab. It will
    ask for a 'silva_root_id'; fill in the name of your silva root --
    usually this is just 'silva'. Then click on 'Run
    script'. Upgrading should now proceed. This will take a while.

    After it is done, your Silva install should be updated, except the
    page templates in the Silva Root dealing with the public layout
    (as you may have changed them). See the next section for more
    information on this.
    
  Page templates for presentation of public views
    
    The upgrade will have installed new default versions of the page
    templates used for presentation of the public website, prefixed
    with 'default_', i.e. 'default_content.html',
    'default_layout_macro.html', 'default_standard_error_message' and
    'default_frontend.css'. You may want to replace your own versions
    with these, if you haven't modified them. Note that these default
    versions may contain some fixes compared to the versions delivered
    with the previous release, so it may be advisable to review them
    in any case (there were only minor changes from 0.8.3 to 0.8.4).

  What the upgrade script does.

    The upgrade will automatically replace the installed services (non
    Silva content) with new versions. The upgrade script will keep a
    backup of the previous components in the 'backup' folder in the
    upgrade folder. If you suddenly miss some changes you made in the
    'service_view_registry' for instance, you should be able to find
    them in there.

    The upgrade will also install new default versions of the page
    templates used for presentation of the public website (see
    previous section).
