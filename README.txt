Silva

  Silva is a Zope-based web application designed for the creation and
  management of structured, textual content. Silva allows users to
  enter new documents as well as edit existing documents using a web
  interface.

  Silva stores the content in a structured format (XML), and keeps a
  strict separation between the way the content is used and the way it
  is presented. This leads to several important advantages:

    * The same content can be used in different media, such as the
      web, paper, or word processor content. Web publication of
      content is native to Silva as it is based on Zope, but Silva
      also has export filters to PDF and MS Word, and more can be
      built when the demand arises. Note: these export filters are not
      included in this release. They will be released as separate
      applications (Docma).

    * The content is future proofed and not out of date as soon as
      you want to use a new system or present it in a different way.

    * The structuring of the content facilitates more sophisticated
      searching and indexing.

  Silva supports (but does not require) a separation between authors
  who can create new content and editors who can approve whether
  content actually gets published. It also allows delegation of
  editing or authoring responsibilities of a section of the
  publication to others. Thus, users can be empowered (avoiding a
  single-person bottleneck), without the loss of editorial control.

  To assist in the publication process, Silva implements workflow
  where multiple versions of the same document are kept around at the
  same time. One version of a particular document may be published
  while another version can be edited at the same time.

  Silva is extensible with new document types and other types of
  content objects.
