Known issues with Silva 1.1b1
-----------------------------

The XSLT-renderers 'Images On Right' and 'Normal View (XSLT)' contain these
issues:

- Tables are not rendered completely correctly: Column width and
  alignment are ignored by the new renderers. This will be fixed ASAP.

- Tables of Content are not rendered correctly at all.

  For public sites that use these features, it is recommended to wait
  for a fix to these two problems before switching the default
  renderer to one of the new ones.

  Note that the renderers of course do not change or remove
  information in the document, so even if you use them, and create
  content that is for now not displayed correctly, it will be once we
  have a patch and you apply that.

The full-media (.zip) import export system has some known bugs in the
handling of workflow, and does not support SilvaExternalSources yet.
