SilvaMetadata 0.10 (DCI)
------------------------

Silva Metadata can be used to create metadata sets and associate these
with Zope object types. The metadata can be configured to be cataloged
automatically.

ProxyIndex 1.2 (DCI)

available plugin index. Used by SilvaMetadata.

http://www.infrae.com/download/ProxyIndex

Sprout 0.6.2 (DCI)
------------------

Sprout is a pure-python library that can also be installed as a Zope
product for convenience. It contains various support modules for
Silva's new XML import/export system as well as the new forms editor
parser.

http://www.infrae.com/download/Sprout

Kupu 1.2.2 (DI)
---------------

Kupu is a client-side WYSIWYG editor. If kupu is installed, Silva
allows users to use kupu in addition to the forms-based editor to edit
Silva Documents.

http://kupu.oscom.org/download/

SilvaDocument 1.4 (DE)
----------------------

Silva extension for XML-based documents. Contains a through the web
editing system for them. This is shipped along with the core, though
strictly speaking it is optional. Uses XMLWidgets and ParsedXML. Can
optionally be extended with SilvaExternalSources.

http://www.infrae.com/download/SilvaDocument

XMLWidgets 0.12 (DI)
--------------------

A system used to construct the forms-based editor for XML used by
SilvaDocument. Integrates with ParsedXML.

http://www.infrae.com/download/XMLWidgets

ParsedXML 1.4 (DI)
------------------

A DOM-compliant storage for XML documents. Used by
SilvaDocument. XMLWidgets integrates with it.

http://www.infrae.com/download/ParsedXML

PlacelessTranslationService 1.0 (DI)
------------------------------------

Translation service which can be used by Silva. It is safe to
deinstall it, though -- Silva will continue to work with the English
user interface.

Groups 0.4 (IX)
---------------

Groups support is optional; Silva should run without the Groups
product installed. Groups use a rather hackish technique called
'monkey patching' to hook groups support into the Silva core, and this
may conflict with other products that do the same. If you get strange
behavior, removing the Groups product and restarting Zope will safely
remove it.

See INSTALL.txt for details on how to install Groups.

To start using the Groups definitions, a "Groups Service" is
needed. Once the Groups Filesystem Product is installed, such a
service can be added to the Silva Root via the ZMI. This service
should have ``service_groups`` for its id.

LDAPUserFolder 2.3 (IX)
-----------------------

The LDAP User Folder is a user folder replacement for Zope that
authenticates Zope users against LDAP.

Compatibility: LDAPUserFolder versions 2.4.0 beta1 and higher require
Python 2.2.3 and higher, and in order to use the User ID/Login
separation you need a Zope version higher than 2.7.0.

ExtFile 1.4.2 (IX)
------------------

If you plan to manage large upload files with Silva, you may want to
avoid storing them in the ZODB, instead putting them in the filesystem
of your server. You can do this by install ExtFile (see INSTALL.txt
for more details).

http://www.zope.org/Members/shh/ExtFile

MailDropHost 1.9 (IX)
---------------------

The MaildropHost product provides support for sending email from
within the Zope environment using MaildropHost objects. Unlike the
built-in MailHost object, the sending is done asynchronously from a
separate process.

http://www.dataflake.org/software/maildrophost/

SilvaExternalSources 0.10 (EX)
------------------------------

External Sources can integrate with SilvaDocument so that data coming
from arbitrary Python sources, SQL databases or CSV (comma separated
values) can be shown inside SilvaDocuments.

------------------

SilvaNews builds on Silva and SilvaDocument to provide News
Publication, News Filters and News Viewers as well as News Articles
