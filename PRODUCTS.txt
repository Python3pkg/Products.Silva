FileSystemSite 1.4 (DCI)
------------------------

FileSystemSite is a Zope extension extracted from the CMF Core. It can
be used to maintain page templates, python scripts and the like on the
filesystem, which makes for easier development, distribution and
installation. Silva and extensions use this for the view
system. SilvaDocument also uses it for the forms-based editor.

----------------------

Formulator is a Zope extension for the easy construction, display and
validation of web forms. Silva and various extension use this for the
display of forms. Also used by SilvaMetadata.

SilvaMetadata 0.7.6 (DCI)
-------------------------

Silva Metadata can be used to create metadata sets and associate these
with Zope object types. The metadata can be configured to be cataloged
automatically.

Annotations 0.4.3 (DCI)
-----------------------

A system for attaching information to Zope objects without changing
them. Used by SilvaMetadata.

http://www.zope.org/Members/infrae/Annotations

ProxyIndex 1.1.2 (DCI)
----------------------

ProxyIndex is a plugin catalog index. It uses a TALES expression
instead of an attribute lookup/call to retrieve the value to index
from an object. The value retrieved can then be indexed by any
available plugin index. Used by SilvaMetadata.

SilvaDocument 1.0 (DE)
----------------------

Silva extension for XML-based documents. Contains a through the web
editing system for them. This is shipped along with the core, though
strictly speaking it is optional. Uses XMLWidgets and ParsedXML. Can
optionally be extended with SilvaExternalSources.

http://www.zope.org/Members/infrae/SilvaDocument

XMLWidgets 0.10.3 (DI)
----------------------

A system used to construct the forms-based editor for XML used by
SilvaDocument. Integrates with ParsedXML.

http://www.zope.org/Members/infrae/XMLWidgets

ParsedXML 1.3.1 (DI)
--------------------

A DOM-compliant storage for XML documents. Used by
SilvaDocument. XMLWidgets integrates with it.

http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/ParsedXML

Groups 0.4 (I)
--------------

Groups support is optional; Silva should run without the Groups
product installed. Groups use a rather hackish technique called
'monkey patching' to hook groups support into the Silva core, and this
may conflict with other products that do the same. If you get strange
behavior, removing the Groups product and restarting Zope will safely
remove it.

See INSTALL.txt for details on how to install Groups.

To start using the Groups definitions, a "Groups Service" is
needed. Once the Groups Filesystem Product is installed, such a
service can be added to the Silva Root via the ZMI. This service
should have ``service_groups`` for its id.

ExtFile 1.4.2 (I)
-----------------

If you plan to manage large upload files with Silva, you may want to
avoid storing them in the ZODB, instead putting them in the filesystem
of your server. You can do this by install ExtFile (see INSTALL.txt
for more details).

http://www.zope.org/Members/shh/ExtFile

SilvaExternalSources 0.7 (E)
----------------------------

External Sources can integrate with SilvaDocument so that data coming
from arbitrary Python sources, SQL databases or CSV (comma separated
values) can be shown inside SilvaDocuments.

http://www.zope.org/Members/infrae/SilvaExternalSources

SilvaNews 0.9 (E)
-----------------

SilvaNews builds on Silva and SilvaDocument to provide News
Publication, News Filters and News Viewers as well as News Articles
and Agenda Items to build a distributed news system for your Silva
site. It also contains RSS export and import facilities.

http://www.zope.org/Members/infrae/SilvaNews

Docma Server 0.7
----------------

A separate system that can sit on a Windows machine and translate
Silva XML to MS Word documents, and back. This can be integrated into
the Silva UI by enabling service_docma.
