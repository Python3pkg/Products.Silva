Sprout 0.7 (DCI)

Kupu 1.4 pre-infrae (DI)
------------------------

Kupu is a client-side WYSIWYG editor. If kupu is installed, Silva
allows users to use kupu in addition to the forms-based editor to edit
Silva Documents.

http://kupu.oscom.org/download/

SilvaDocument 1.6 (DE)
----------------------

Silva extension for XML-based documents. Contains a through the web
editing system for them. This is shipped along with the core, though
strictly speaking it is optional. Uses XMLWidgets and ParsedXML. Can
optionally be extended with SilvaExternalSources.

http://www.infrae.com/download/SilvaDocument

XMLWidgets 0.13 (DI)
--------------------

A system used to construct the forms-based editor for XML used by
SilvaDocument. Integrates with ParsedXML.

http://www.infrae.com/download/XMLWidgets

ParsedXML 1.5 (DI)
------------------

A DOM-compliant storage for XML documents. Used by
SilvaDocument. XMLWidgets integrates with it.

http://www.infrae.com/download/ParsedXML

Groups 0.5 (IX)
---------------

Groups support is optional; Silva should run without the Groups
product installed. Groups use a rather hackish technique called
'monkey patching' to hook groups support into the Silva core, and this
may conflict with other products that do the same. If you get strange
behavior, removing the Groups product and restarting Zope will safely
remove it.

See INSTALL.txt for details on how to install Groups.

To start using the Groups definitions, a "Groups Service" is
needed. Once the Groups Filesystem Product is installed, such a
service can be added to the Silva Root via the ZMI. This service
should have ``service_groups`` for its id.

http://www.infrae.com/download/Groups

LDAPUserFolder 2.3 (IX)
-----------------------

The LDAP User Folder is a user folder replacement for Zope that
authenticates Zope users against LDAP.

Compatibility: LDAPUserFolder versions 2.4.0 beta1 and higher require
Python 2.2.3 and higher, and in order to use the User ID/Login
separation you need a Zope version higher than 2.7.0.

http://www.dataflake.org/software/ldapuserfolder/

ExtFile 1.4.2 (IX)
------------------

Note: Silva 1.5 is not compatible yet with ExtFile.

If you plan to manage large upload files with Silva, you may want to
avoid storing them in the ZODB, instead putting them in the filesystem
of your server. You can do this by install ExtFile (see INSTALL.txt
for more details).

http://www.zope.org/Members/shh/ExtFile

MailDropHost 1.9 (IX)
---------------------

The MaildropHost product provides support for sending email from
within the Zope environment using MaildropHost objects. Unlike the
built-in MailHost object, the sending is done asynchronously from a
separate process.

http://www.dataflake.org/software/maildrophost/

SilvaExternalSources 0.12 (EX)
------------------------------

External Sources can integrate with SilvaDocument so that data coming
from arbitrary Python sources, SQL databases or CSV (comma separated
values) can be shown inside SilvaDocuments.

http://www.infrae.com/download/SilvaExternalSources

SilvaNewsNetwork 2.1 (EX)
-------------------------

SilvaNewsNetwork (formerly known as SilvaNews) builds on Silva and 
SilvaDocument to provide News Publication, News Filters and News Viewers as

for your Silva site. It also contains RSS export and import facilities.
