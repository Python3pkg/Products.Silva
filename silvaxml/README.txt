Warning: The Silva XML import/export machinery in this directory is not, and
really SHOULD NOT be used for now. It was developed specifically for one
customer, and unfortunately, there was no time to adapt it for general use 
for this Silva-release. The API is soon to be replaced by a more generic and
developer-friendly one. If you are interested in using that for your
own development right now, please contact me directly or through the 
silva-dev mailing list (which you can join at 
http://lists.infrae.com/mailman/listinfo/silva-dev).
